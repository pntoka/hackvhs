Each\nvideo in this series will break down a complex topic related to safety and\nintegrity on our platforms. In our first episode, we take a look at how\nFacebook is fighting COVID-19 vaccine misinformation.\n\n![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y4/r/-PAXP-deijE.gif)\n\nSomething went wrong\n\nWe're having trouble with playing this video.\n\n[Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/396404120401278/list)\n\nTo address the challenge of misinformation on our platforms, we’ve built a\nglobal network of more than 80 independent fact-checkers who review content in\nmore than 60 languages. And thanks to these significant investments in people\nand technology — like Artificial Intelligence — we’re making progress.  \n  \nSince the pandemic began, our AI systems have taken down COVID-19-related\nmaterial that global health experts have flagged as misinformation and then\ndetected copies when someone tries to share them. As a result, we’ve removed\nmore than 12 million pieces of content about COVID-19 and vaccines.  \n  \nBut it’s not enough to just limit misinformation that people might see. We\nalso connect people to reliable information from trusted experts. Through our\nCOVID-19 information center, notifications in people’s feeds on Facebook and\nInstagram, and through labels with reliable information from experts that we\nattach to certain posts, we’ve been able to help surface reliable information\nwhile reducing the visibility of misinformation. In fact, we know that when a\nwarning screen is placed on a post, 95% of the time people refrain from\nclicking it. And now with COVID-19 vaccines rolling out to people around the\nworld, we're driving a global campaign to help bring [50 million people a step\ncloser to getting COVID-19\nvaccines.](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.fb.com%2Fnews%2F2021%2F03%2Fmark-\nzuckerberg-announces-facebooks-plans-to-help-get-people-vaccinated-against-\ncovid-19%2F&h=AT3vBQYLs5HGBgMmbo5Eh2zgSiBvtcTcrW5c1IXAXG6ceRseTsWn_-\nYcrnIGNK4s31IOKwIqbOReX8tTrB_BMFk2Fx3SJgFzVCi0etrlOkGfRlO2vP05L4Aw0hKbzJE6g3MFS7VF1O18a0_S-\nUl1_eavno2HKcgX)\n\nIn our next episode of Let Me Explain we’ll dive into how we develop our\n[Community Standards](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/) and where\nwe draw the line between freedom of expression and safety.

Fuelled by rising incomes, this new middle-class\ncommunity across Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam\nwill approach 350 million people with a combined disposable income of USD 300\nbillion by 2022.1 The importance of this audience can no longer be ignored, or\nthe opportunity to understand the people in it better. In the past, some\nadvertisers may have overlooked these important consumers, thinking them slow\nto adopt digital platforms and tools simply because they were located far from\nbig cities. Today, we know this is a myth, as digital adoption and expansion\nin the top five Southeast Asian countries shows otherwise.\n\n### A Leapfrogging Economy2\n\n### Smartphones are everywhere\n\n![The use of smartphones](https://scontent-\nlhr8-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/49971298_951642875039463_2595793356558696448_n.svg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f537c7&_nc_ohc=SQys_CcBDnwQ7kNvgGVy-\nMV&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr8-2.xx&_nc_gid=AAmH9DoZjKiiSw_MtkxnFFQ&oh=00_AYAxjw16FT41zohYDSX0BSU5hxH5KS3mxW7pwui91XvNCQ&oe=67511BDC)\n\nSmartphone connections to total market population\n\n(ID, PH, VN, MY, TH)\n\n### Electronic payments are spreading fast\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr8-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/49786222_2113507262295909_5410421447241760768_n.svg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=DXYP7mz2ErcQ7kNvgG3wQuA&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr8-2.xx&_nc_gid=AAmH9DoZjKiiSw_MtkxnFFQ&oh=00_AYB_Ap2J6Efm6aqB-\nFCYKeb3en0A6kP_Lrkeir9GYsMmMA&oe=6765A62A)\n\n>USD 30BAmount forecasted for SEA mobile payments by 2022\n\n### Logistics investments are reflecting the e-commerce fast growth in the\nregion\n\n![Increase in e-commerce logistics](https://scontent-\nlhr6-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/49850707_758597014474809_4591009685087191040_n.svg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f537c7&_nc_ohc=gRkuEHhIF-\nkQ7kNvgEWkpdG&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr6-1.xx&_nc_gid=AAmH9DoZjKiiSw_MtkxnFFQ&oh=00_AYAodya1R1guMhkA4Pp3U0JisfV7kGbihbhl8tYcexfAfw&oe=67513B49)\n\nSEA E-commerce logistics spend by market\n\nTo help marketers gain a better understanding of this untapped market and\nrising consumer segment – who they are and the issues they face as they move\nforward balancing modernisation with respect for tradition – Facebook and Bain\n& Company worked with Quantum to conduct an extensive study in 16 non-capital\ncities across Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. The\nresearch was comprised of 160 face-to-face group interviews and 80 consumer\nethnographic immersions in June 2018, across five markets and covered a range\nof consumer behaviours and attitudes. Separately, Bain & Company conducted an\nonline survey of 4,745 digital consumers across Indonesia, Malaysia, the\nPhilippines, Thailand and Vietnam, which helped to provide more in-depth views\nof the emerging middle-class landscape of the top five Southeast Asian\ncountries.\n\nAs part of the research, we also spoke with 40 industry business leaders\nacross Southeast Asia and found that despite the fact that 77% recognised the\nemerging middle class as a driver of growth, only 15% of the leaders think\nthat their companies are ready to market to the emerging middle class, with\n60% stating that they lacked a clear marketing strategy.3\n\nBy increasing their digital footprint, members of this growing group widen\ntheir world view beyond the limits of work, neighbourhoods or traditional\nexpectations. They now enjoy a huge privilege that previous generations did\nnot: greater power to choose. They can choose the person they want to be, the\npeople they want to be with, the places they want to go and the passions they\nwant to follow. Business leaders looking to reach this hugely influential\ngroup can begin by understanding these four shifts.\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/49757678_2213256892246831_4615827466412359680_n.jpg?stp=dst-\nwebp&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=UQJ2HqnKdYQQ7kNvgH3o1QC&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx&_nc_gid=AAmH9DoZjKiiSw_MtkxnFFQ&oh=00_AYB-6D_1avbwRdFjP3yK1pAgpERJXagNoWbT-\nHCajdNBRw&oe=67659176)Power to define identities\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr8-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/49934362_302417287062947_7186430367333613568_n.jpg?stp=dst-\nwebp&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=IKUzFQ3iT_sQ7kNvgGUwXW2&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr8-2.xx&_nc_gid=AAmH9DoZjKiiSw_MtkxnFFQ&oh=00_AYBJQKVPgX_BtSZw0qyoAxjz0yKazTk0eQcMc5KwST2Pxg&oe=6765A847)Power\nto reach broader communities\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/49861555_760946797601455_1790601445142167552_n.jpg?stp=dst-\nwebp&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=dyhQQVdhDpUQ7kNvgGhhDSB&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx&_nc_gid=AAmH9DoZjKiiSw_MtkxnFFQ&oh=00_AYAqBLNnFajI2zY-KXGmjBxgLYa-\nXAB9FCCkUoGDzuik0A&oe=676580C2)Power to pursue dreams and passions\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr8-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/49833001_280225026021406_1282535405622657024_n.jpg?stp=dst-\nwebp&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=A9t3TUpF824Q7kNvgE0mtB7&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr8-2.xx&_nc_gid=AAmH9DoZjKiiSw_MtkxnFFQ&oh=00_AYDZjFGBdNAotzyakuNwoJk-\nUML3Q4_iYZFGn26fi_bimA&oe=6765A45B)Power to gain joyful experiences\n\n## [Download the full Facebook IQ\nreport](/business/f/2245379779017422/?file_name=southeast_asia_new_emerging_middle_class_inline_download&nav_ref=fb_for_business_responsive_link)\non Southeast Asia's emerging middle class and their digital journey.\n\n![Download the Facebook guide to automotive enthusiasts](https://scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/49901061_394284681399158_8987517103250604032_n.jpg?stp=dst-\nwebp&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=Cc0GF_9IBWUQ7kNvgF849UC&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx&_nc_gid=AAmH9DoZjKiiSw_MtkxnFFQ&oh=00_AYBnf2Xnb0e-4g86evgKws-G65S3Cb0b9NBebidYRBHqiQ&oe=6765A9EC)\n\nThe power to define identities\n\n### The power to define identities\n\nToday's emerging middle-class consumers are able to define their own modern\nidentities through the power of digital connectivity, while still maintaining\nstrong ties to their traditional cultural backgrounds.

Much like boomers redefined retirement, Gen Xers are redefining middle\nage.\n\nThe critical reframe? Midlife doesn't have to be a crisis. It's more of a\nsecond adolescence – a middlescence – just with less awkwardness and more\nself-love. Midlifers are choosing to live this as a period of renewal and\nreassessment. On Facebook, conversation around **_middle age_** is very much\nalive, as people find inspiration in the way **_a rolling stone gathers no\nmoss_**.1 They are unlocking the power of **_self-reflection_** – and even\n**_Bodhipakkhiyādhammā_** (the qualities conducive to awakening) – with people\naged 35-54 overindexing on these discussions compared to younger generations.1\n\nIn search of balance and control in their lives, midlifers are reassessing\ntheir relationships and revitalising their careers and finances. They're\nexercising, socialising, adventuring and seeking new experiences, including\nholidays. In short, they're taking care of themselves – a strategy with\ndefinite staying power. As midlifers extend their timeline for becoming their\ntruest and best selves, expect to see an openness to new mindsets, habits and\nproducts as people look for guidance, understanding and acknowledgment,\nwhether from friends, creators or brands.\n\nRISING GLOBAL CONVERSATION TOPICS1\n\n _Midlifers (aged 35-54) are more likely than an average Facebook or Instagram\nuser to discuss

Although more than 5 billion people have received at least one dose\nof the COVID-19 vaccine worldwide, countries with weaker health systems and\nmultiple competing health challenges have limited capacity to roll out\nwidespread COVID-19 vaccination. These countries often have overstretched\nhealth workforces, limited investment in risk communication and community\nengagement, and challenges with vaccine hesitancy in some communities.\n\nOver the last year, Data for Good at Meta has been collaborating with UNICEF,\nthe Yale Institute for Global Health, and the Public Good Projects (PGP) to\ndevelop campaigns that drive COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Kenya, India,\nPakistan, and Ukraine, and that have reached more than 150 million people. In\ncelebration of World Immunization week, we analyzed the results of these\ncampaigns and are sharing lessons we learned about the most effective messages\nfor public health practitioners to learn from.\n\n## Campaign messages and content\n\nIn spring 2021, the Data for Good team at Meta worked to analyze [_public\nFacebook posts_](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/tools/insights-for-\nimpact) about the COVID-19 vaccine to understand drivers behind vaccine\nhesitancy being discussed on Facebook, as well as the main reasons for\nhesitancy from Facebook’s [_COVID Trends and Impact\nSurvey_](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/covid-\nsurvey/vaccines?location=USA&level=0) (CTIS). UNICEF, the Yale Institute for\nGlobal Health, and PGP assessed these insights and subsequently produced\nrelevant content for each country.\n\nAfter launching the campaigns via the relevant UNICEF country office page, we\nmeasured the effectiveness of different messages by comparing post-campaign\nsurvey responses of people who saw the ads with those of people who did not.\nThe survey asked respondents whether they remembered seeing the ad recently,\nas well as up to four other questions relating to awareness and attitudes\nabout the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n## What we learned\n\n### Providing practical information and answering common questions with\nlocally relevant content is critical\n\nAnalysis of public Facebook posts revealed that people had basic questions\nabout COVID-19 vaccine safety, efficacy, availability, and eligibility, with\nthe specifics of these concerns varying between countries. Survey data\nrevealed that in Kenya and Ukraine, concerns about potential side effects were\nthe main reason for hesitancy; however, in India and Pakistan, most people\nindicated that they wanted to wait and potentially get a vaccine at a later\ndate. In Ukraine, public posts also suggested that some people were interested\nin getting the vaccine but might need additional nudging to do so, and that\nmany people had lingering questions about safety and efficacy.\n\nFor each country, we worked to ensure that the campaign content reflected the\ncommunity’s main concerns and questions. In Ukraine, for example, the insights\nled to the development of two campaigns — one that provided information on\neligibility and how to register for the vaccine, and a second that focused on\nvaccine safety and efficacy. Similarly in Kenya, one campaign focused on\nproviding practical information to young adults stating that they were\neligible and that vaccines were freely available. Apart from the information\nin the ads themselves, all campaigns included links to government or UNICEF\nresource pages where people could click to read more about the vaccine or\nregister for an appointment.\n\nIn Ukraine, the campaign that provided information on eligibility and\nregistration succeeded in improving the likelihood that people would advise\ntheir friends to get vaccinated, and the safety and efficacy campaign\nincreased perceptions of vaccine importance. Similarly, in Kenya, the\npractical campaign was effective at improving perceptions of vaccine safety.\n\nIn India and Pakistan, content in local languages, rather than the national\nlanguage of English, also led to higher percentages of people clicking on the\nlinks to vaccine resource pages provided in the ads than the English content\ndid. This finding is helpful for settings where the assumption might be that\nonline populations will be more likely to engage in English content despite\nthere being large populations both online and offline that may be more\nattracted to content featured in languages such as Hindi and Urdu.\n\n### Values-based messaging and tapping into relevant social norms was an\neffective strategy\n\nExisting [_behavioral science\nresearch_](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41562-017-0256-5&h=AT2rUAkHicFKh2oT4EzX_sguAZUCmHJkddzE6b3Hk0q97xyP1dPzo__V8ytuII-0NuTkb0MXOwcMGb6U4BkGkzfqY3rO57BtrOdJErTwFr-b9rITn6K45iB3jkt6JWDyui9PRfZtR6tI-0MNdzT903ENU7ZWIa5H)\nhas found a significant association between vaccine hesitancy and the\nupholding of certain moral values such as personal liberty and a belief in\npurity. Meanwhile, [_prior\nresearch_](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.sagepub.com%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1177%2F1069031X211073179&h=AT1U6PazNwEKmK4MpZ9ZgFz38iwxmVmj7kE8Lgp5tDhLqdKD1lAo04LAYNRCGB30JjIyivhpB8NOLdqJHYAGD5eEhdFK6GsG05eiUg-\niZdz_OYNCfMRFIB5uE3qlkexYWLcH0EHMIbsJsxfS7c7_NhDLTRK3Ojq0) suggests that\nleveraging local social norms such as collectivism and equity can be powerful\ntools in influencing people’s likelihood to vaccinate.\n\nIn our public post analysis, Data for Good at Meta found discussion of moral\nvalues and social norms were common across countries. For example, when\nposting about vaccines in Ukraine, many people emphasized the right to choose\nwhether to vaccinate, suggesting that liberty is a core value of many\nUkranians. In India, however, many posts expressed pride that India had\nproduced its own vaccine and was distributing it to other countries at the\ntime. Meanwhile, in Pakistan, public posts about the vaccine discussed\nconcerns about inequity in vaccine access. Such values were leveraged in the\nmessaging content and creative design.\n\nAs a result of our pre-campaign research, UNICEF Ukraine ran messages\nemphasizing that vaccines are a personal choice that can lead to positive\noutcomes for individuals and their families, which worked well for improving\nperceptions that it was better to get vaccinated than to risk getting\nCOVID-19. Leveraging local insights in India, the team developed a campaign\nthat underscored collective action and used India-focused imagery, which\nperformed especially well at increasing the likelihood that the Hindi-speaking\naudience would advise a close friend or relative to get the COVID-19 vaccine.\nIn Pakistan, insights informed the development of a campaign focused on the\nvalues of fairness and equity that achieved the strong results across several\noutcomes tested in Pakistan and was particularly successful in improving\nperceptions of vaccine importance.\n\n### Storytelling and testimonials are powerful outreach tools\n\nExisting [_public\nhealth_](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fpii%2FS0264410X18306121%3Fvia%253Dihub&h=AT0l1K5geaqZm52in6JcWs2wjTF-L4OBNHW55RHVLQ4WAxMO46-lV7Iqwh5z8a3pOU47-ILuOL0SUXKQSoEhF94EbVSD-\nbeYvfMXH9yXVppcXNcmSwWJ-B7N8kyOy1GPOgcKPum6SStqrbZLU0JzUPiAoRWngf-J) research\nhas found approaches such as parental stories can be effective in getting\npeople to seek more information about vaccines, and UNICEF and Yale’s\n[_Vaccine Messaging\nGuide_](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unicef.org%2Fdocuments%2Fvaccine-\nmessaging-\nguide&h=AT2VbMekUCNmc5cOqvZDs0sZLCBtCU2ZKSRZFs9YEN4EtvL1EDX5pu5qgd5yox9jRd07xlLinEl2CkO6egxedGjCUUI27hGGzq87ax1DiLSfnxY9gQF1t2DY1yoA_1JThpjY15cec9s7zYXwHev0PCYQpF477D6W)\noutlines that using narrative techniques can be a compelling messaging\nstrategy. In our own precampaign research, we found that many people in India\nshared on Facebook their personal stories of being vaccinated and encouraged\nothers to do the same. In India, a high proportion of public posts also showed\nappreciation for health-care workers. Meanwhile in Pakistan, public posts\nrevealed that many people were trying to register their parents and older\nrelatives for a vaccine appointment, which offered an opportunity to tell\nlocally relevant stories about young people working to protect elderly members\nof their families.\n\nIn India, our findings prompted the development of testimonial-style\nillustrative content featuring health-care workers, and in Pakistan, the\nresulting campaign featured everyday people expressing their eagerness to do\ntheir part and get vaccinated, as well as to register loved ones, including\nolder relatives, to do the same. In India, the storytelling campaign was\nparticularly effective for improving perceptions of social approval of the\nvaccine and the likelihood that people would recommend the vaccine to their\nfriends. Similarly, in Pakistan, the testimonial campaign was effective for\nimproving the likelihood that people would recommend getting the vaccine to\nclose friends and relatives.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nAcross four countries and over 150 million people reached, results from our\ncampaigns on the COVID-19 vaccine suggest that filling gaps in basic\ninformation, developing messages that speak to relevant values and social\nnorms, and leveraging techniques like testimonials and storytelling with\neffective messengers can all be powerful tools in combating vaccine hesitancy.\n\nAlthough these findings represent a substantial step forward in understanding\nhow to increase vaccine acceptance through digital outreach, this research and\nmessage testing represents the first phase of this collaboration between\nUNICEF, the Yale Institute for Global Health, PGP, and Meta. Currently, we are\nconducting randomized control trials in India, Pakistan, and Ukraine to test\nwhether these digital campaigns lead to improved vaccine confidence and higher\nimmunization rates overall, which will further illuminate the role that\ndigital campaigns can play in advancing global public health goals.\n\nSpecial thanks to Surangani Abeyesekera, Social and Behavior Change\nSpecialist, Demand for Immunization at UNICEF HQ, as well as Dr. Saad Omer,\nSarah Christie, Amyn Malik, and Scott Bokemper from Yale Institute for Global\nHealth for their contributions to this research.\n\n**Areas**\n\n[Data Science](/research-area/data-science/)\n\n**Tags**\n\n[Data for Good](/tag/data-for-good/)\n\n**Share**\n\n  * Copy URL \n  * [ Share on Twitter ](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2F&h=AT2kOrCtGJf8W8qKxi5FIduTZnwWHVhSBtB_lq3nQN52F1_UqxltjJhM18UQbRTDJV8CbSC_83Pzsd1_XsdiztBmazBN6qzrOBTgtcWHA2QGGlUoo32kJf1gllhKIGc06K-hHSXGPuebJTW0z25mA5701vclJNZx)\n  * [ Share on Facebook ](https://facebook.com/)\n\n* * *\n\n## Featured News\n\n[All News](/blog/)\n\n![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y4/r/-PAXP-deijE.gif)\n\nMay 17, 2023\n\n### [How generational differences affect consumer attitudes towards\nads](https://research.facebook.com/blog/2023/5/how-generational-differences-\naffect-consumer-attitudes-towards-ads/)\n\n![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y4/r/-PAXP-deijE.gif)\n\nApril 17, 2023\n\n### [Every tree counts](https://research.facebook.com/blog/2023/4/every-tree-\ncounts-large-scale-mapping-of-canopy-height-at-the-resolution-of-individual-\ntrees/)\n\n![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y4/r/-PAXP-deijE.gif)\n\nApril 14, 2023\n\n### [How a non-traditional background led to cutting-edge XR\ntech](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacareers.com%2Flife%2Fhow-\na-non-traditional-background-led-to-cutting-edge-xr-\ntech&h=AT2TdMPXlAc7cBsW8oepohRdAR_4rmgzWPuJD0NvbyWRUYwRSaWqDFuLDZnO41vfm42JVM-\nwzKwShyixJdIaitCzHd5y28HWlTixFk-O4ho8yHLOPPVjhvj_YKIVRr5s5EahkOFAIZ3aPQzz1CwTxTLA_jNLCYXU)\n\n[Meta\nCareers](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacareers.com%2Flife%2Fhow-\na-non-traditional-background-led-to-cutting-edge-xr-\ntech&h=AT0801hB9F0XGiNt6Xx1ZkKmZv6J7IomFBNFgoFP0SU3Z42233z76jVH3SsAUToCL-\n_tIxusvX49p9FJfoQ4PihLI336edMYbzk06bd3bgvTfsqUFZvUF1_FcPoHtRvJrrm5geoVZrpk7cYajjyzLHGPBePrqpP0)\n\n[![Meta](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/yJ/r/C1E_YZIckM5.svg)](https://research.facebook.com/)\n\nSearchSubmit\n\n## Meta Research\n\n  * [Publications](/publications)\n  * [Requests for Proposals](/research-awards)\n  * [RFP Funding Recipients](/research-award-recipients)\n  * [Fellows](/fellows)\n  * [Datasets](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ffort.fb.com%2Fresearcher-datasets&h=AT1EU7YdrHUw3dYYy9SeKIgeg_sDccRvGrOfalyGSsi8XFBekPe9lZSKjpe8sCBjnahTxt9QcG8-UE433MjOED67Ejmv2qVoH2aigBXtleI0LOD8EBdCEzZutGMytmUd1cfS-uv8MSMGGDgujnK24Mu79F2kt-89)\n  * [Careers](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacareers.com%2Fareas-of-work%2Fresearch%2F%3Fp%5Bteams%5D%5B0%5D%3DResearch%26teams%5B0%5D%3DResearch&h=AT2aNkjraAAwnSfnA62Ms926I0XOu9WHU5skIZqSmZps3p9Z1cP6H0xJVM4m-ao19FRH-IFta5_FkUqMMq1M7mEX9-uaSYRypL3sPGSezjLFOMWBGazKd1giRAjMs6KNncSxgUHWHDiTuEUvGE9nnIrC1R0OpfA0)\n\n## Visit Our Other Blogs\n\n  * [Blog](/blog)\n  * [Engineering](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fengineering.fb.com%2F&h=AT2D0PsgdFJylaOL4SUCWgoxCMWmhKVXwKv-bmTIK84z5D7u2RmdAYZ3teGV6FRVFolC1Rat539VsUKGqAJIEaXFYQeOcwHAYc8v3qAwkCAWwto2Umb4_jjXf5uoHTlIjj3l_4am594xAGmgmDip39In4ahIftW1)\n  * [Meta AI](http://ai.facebook.com/)\n  * [Meta Quest](https://oculus.com/blog/)\n  * [Tech at Meta](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.fb.com%2F&h=AT3i_jJFPEjjLosP2itItUE0crG8SIrHAK5_qBfWxMR5Kp4m94JtdLmpXaTTDQux-afIilUddEDkRGP0gNJlP4-_x4sNQazIQMSrOnEmjyytoSA22zH9IsDUa-styiZi_gRBiC6cKDcsB1HzJrQMM3yM9gFAEPPV)\n\n  * [RSS Feed](https://research.facebook.com/feed/)\n  * [About](https://about.facebook.com/)\n  * [Careers](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacareers.com%2F&h=AT2Sb2G7aovsOvyeayTSB6HGQv-I2K_yw0_yx2XWVKLkZYE0H5JdMrK9egvpmCxdxl5vTLQIXzfNqp7HKz1Wcb09Cpl4GK7bgOdw8Qhm6_HRXFxa-XYBv-BedUnVHIotvRmeBFVSgFy79s0DeH98nvjJ4rEjw7Uj)\n  * [Privacy](https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/)\n  * [Cookies](https://www.facebook.com/policy/cookies/)\n  * [Terms](https://www.facebook.com/policies_center)\n  * [Help](https://www.facebook.com/help)\n\nMeta © 2024\n\n",

We also invest significant resources to support fact-checkers during\nmoments of crises and [war](https://about.fb.com/news/2022/02/metas-ongoing-\nefforts-regarding-russias-invasion-of-ukraine/).\n\n##### **Fighting health misinformation**\n\nSince early 2020, Meta has prioritized providing additional support and\nresources to fact-checkers grappling with an increasing number of hoaxes about\nCOVID-19 as well as misinformation related to vaccines. In response:\n\n  * We [launched](https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/coronavirus-grants-fact-checking) a $1 million emergency grant program to support fact-checkers tackling COVID-19, in partnership with the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN). \n  * We [launched](https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/programs/third-party-fact-checking/global-health-fellowship) a year-long health fellowship program with 10 fact-checking organizations that are part of our fact-checking program, to bring on new team members to help them combat health misinformation. Participating organizations represented countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. Together, [these organizations built new products and systems](https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/global-health-fellows-reflect-fact-checking-misinformation) to better address health misinformation. \n  * WhatsApp [invested](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.poynter.org%2Ffact-checking%2F2020%2Fifcn-receives-1-million-from-whatsapp-to-support-fact-checkers-on-the-coronavirus-battlefront%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2HH_FHhgNzAHnRVuEnNCxc4z_I1ZLcnGiadnokVgD8XjIGbAdGP44r9co&h=AT1Rk_NALqQAUqM6UGQsER8Ak4xlZ_3Ykuhz4yTmyQILN4jZW7_SycTkC_kQ91cF1lsSAEk5jRbgA0qfn4LiphFEKRQGYVdNMKa7SgfJ3b3G788wati8ip1fk-u2_jCM9j0k3rQ6W_iaXKrYXDrjEFuRK5eGFHIEJCVs1Y_2q-wLlA) $1 million to support IFCN's COVID-19 efforts, including the CoronaVirusFacts Alliance, in which nearly 100 fact-checking organizations in more than 70 countries produced more than 11,000 fact-checks about the COVID-19 pandemic in 40 languages, according to data collected by the IFCN. As part of this, WhatsApp also [launched](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.poynter.org%2Ffact-checking%2F2020%2Fifcn-receives-1-million-from-whatsapp-to-support-fact-checkers-on-the-coronavirus-battlefront%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2HH_FHhgNzAHnRVuEnNCxc4z_I1ZLcnGiadnokVgD8XjIGbAdGP44r9co&h=AT0kt6U-jKDjlZuEQvrZ4EWI3wzvDNcq8RUXg_0RK1NL8bgk_Yw8toqdt1opjwVSO9IOK_3GYWmuH9tuGoT8ZOpNLq2IctcZNptXignPDtY-gss19LdoaQMjLyu7KAunlqCm7ZCoZuLtEzHOPZ6LTw2fDrP4pChNoIuQnd8ZrZpzpw) a $500,000 grant program to support seven fact-checking organizations’ projects fighting vaccine misinformation, in partnership with the IFCN. \n  * We [launched](https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/facebook-partners-with-meedan-digital-health-lab-to-help-fact-checkers-debunk-health-misinformation) a partnership with the Digital Health Lab at Meedan, a global technology nonprofit, to support fact-checkers in fighting health misinformation online. Meedan’s Digital Health Lab facilitated a series of virtual training sessions between its team of doctors, scientists and health experts and Meta’s [third-party fact-checking partners](https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/programs/third-party-fact-checking/partner-map).\n\n##### **Investing in innovation, collaboration and the future of fact-\nchecking**\n\nMeta has funded programs that foster innovation, support industry\ncollaboration and increase diversity within the fact-checking industry.\n\n  * We [launched](https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/climate-misinformation-grant) the Climate Misinformation Grant in partnership with the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN). As part of our $1 million investment, this initiative offers funding to organizations working to combat climate misinformation and is structured to allow for collaborative partnerships between fact-checkers, climate experts and other organizations. \n  * We launched an [Accelerator Challenge](https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/accelerator-fact-checkers) that brought fact-checking organizations together to innovate, learn from experts and one another, and collaborate on new strategies to grow and expand their reach so that more people are connected to reliable information. Participating publishers in the training program, which was led by expert coaches at Blue Engine Collaborative, reported significant increases in audience growth as a result of the lessons learned during the program. \n  * We partnered with [IFCN](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.poynter.org%2Fifcn%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2_UNm1u3kDYOgFhYXQ7fp1dhAHaM9AIYNctmNYoo-KX3wmmx811hPPnxk&h=AT0Wzecs79-v7i3Oq2cTjNu90Q4vrEYFQvjpNgXJPDSCrxq-EWRL6FcVewOosHLSCzJxXMsQZcuUp_5MZKDrg5ItulvyQO-0nklmsaPV2AOYX87BoKoHRjsRBYsixDKnBx4i71Y9E0ROERvTubAowHqZoAyNmQrx) to launch a [Global Fact-Checking Mentorship Program](https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/third-party-fact-checking/global-mentorship-program-fight-misinformation) to help fact-checkers scale their fact-checking efforts and increase their capacity to detect and debunk misinformation online. Meta will award a total of $450,000, to be administered by IFCN, for selected mentors to develop a mentorship curriculum for the mentee organizations. \n  * We funded a year-long [fact-checking fellowship](https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/programs/third-party-fact-checking/nabj-fellowship) in the US with the National Association of Black Journalists, empowering fact-checking organizations to recruit [emerging journalists](https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/2021-nabj-fellowship-program).\n  * We launched the [Fact-Checking Innovation Initiative](https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/programs/third-party-fact-checking/global-health-fellowship) in partnership with the IFCN to support fact-checkers creating new formats and technologies to benefit the fact-checking ecosystem at large.\n\n##### **Supporting election integrity around the world**\n\nMeta has provided funding support to help fact-checkers increase their\ncapacity to promote reliable information ahead of 2022 elections in various\ncountries, including [Australia](https://australia.fb.com/post/how-meta-is-\npreparing-for-the-2022-australian-election/),\n[France](https://about.fb.com/fr/news/2022/02/elections-francaises-2022-une-\nserie-dinitiatives-dediees-sur-facebook-instagram-et-whatsapp-pour-aider-les-\ncitoyens-a-lire-et-a-decrypter-linformation-en-ligne/),\n[India](https://about.fb.com/news/2022/02/how-meta-is-prepared-to-protect-the-\nupcoming-state-elections-in-india/) and other countries around the world.\n\nWe recognize that strong partnerships and sharing expert information on best\npractices and approaches play a big role in effectively addressing\nmisinformation. That’s why we have also funded programs to facilitate\ncollaboration among fact-checkers, including supporting fact-checkers and\njournalism organizations to form [fact-checking\nconsortia](https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/third-party-fact-\nchecking/latin-american-consortia?locale=hr_HR): virtual assemblies of\njournalists and independent fact-checkers who join forces to help debunk\nmisinformation in the [run-up to\nelections](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rappler.com%2Fnewsbreak%2Ffact-\ncheck%2F223179-tsek-ph-project-newsrooms-universities-fact-check-\nclaims%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR05LavuyITb_TYkTJH1ShpAGUm_k-1DoBxEUArL6Y0_A7lm54hZPXzh9Ks&h=AT1CklJ_yGMIXtCwwPssGMCaoQKkk2b8xZ5YdarPEd42jcsnquwXvLT82gRqqsl52g_GuBIMRaq5mcx-3dC4X89qWkv8hbufjEZHMml1kRRnD-78kSH1G2vQlk20WlyjcdPziC8qEYU4uq8NM9P3FVn_nyAOhsLR).\n\nFor more information about how fact-checkers work with Meta to reduce the\nspread of viral misinformation, visit [FB.me/Third-Party-Fact-\nChecking](https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/programs/third-party-\nfact-checking).\n\nInstruction\n\nDid you find this content helpful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\npage ID\n\ncms id for page\n\npage URL\n\nurl for page\n\n|  \n  \nDid you find this content helpful?\n\nYesNo\n\nInstruction\n\nWhy not?\n\npage ID\n\ncms id for page\n\npage URL\n\nurl for page\n\n|  \n  \nSubmit\n\nThank you for your feedback.\n\n#### MORE STORIES\n\n/5\n\n[![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y4/r/-PAXP-\ndeijE.gif)](https://about.fb.com/)\n\nFollow us\n\n[![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y4/r/-PAXP-\ndeijE.gif)](https://www.facebook.com/MetaforMedia/)\n\nSites\n\n[Meta Audience Network](/audiencenetwork)[Meta for Business](/business)[Meta\nfor Creators](/creators)[Meta Elevate](/fbelevate)[Facebook\nGaming](/fbgaminghome/)[Meta Journalism Project](/formedia/mjp)\n\nResources\n\n[Social editorial calendar](/formedia/social-editorial-calendar)[Media\nAcademy](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fformedia.facebookblueprint.com%2Fstudent%2Fcatalog&h=AT1DknhRY6xVXJN-\nqOBTQcUq0xrZa6nMnWGSQY7s3SbB5zh8j8QhrGCnNKDHVmlsaFZPGeHg9YFibyvPO6LfNrcXXMeXvEO5hH30V-hVFIP9rR5E4ndo0tZdTDSXWGD8lLWvoXuXzIPYFBlchesrhkDZ7D79eOAp)[Media\nSupport Portal](https://business.facebook.com/help/media)[Help Centre](/help)\n\n[Blog](/formedia/blog)\n\n[![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y4/r/-PAXP-\ndeijE.gif)](https://about.fb.com/)\n\nFollow us\n\n[![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y4/r/-PAXP-\ndeijE.gif)](https://www.facebook.com/MetaforMedia)\n\n[ © 2024 Meta ](https://www.facebook.com/)\n\n[Privacy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation)[Terms](https://www.facebook.com/policies)[Cookies](https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies/)\n\n",

Starting this week in the US, we’ll feature links in the COVID-19\nInformation Center to local ministry of health websites to help people\nunderstand whether they’re eligible to get vaccinated and how to do so. And in\nthe coming weeks, as more information becomes available, we’ll continue to\nexpand this feature to more countries and improve it to make it easier for\npeople to see where and when they can get vaccinated in just a few taps.\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/147785107_226181862520432_1748998116551951255_n.png?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=Jw2Y9jfOk9AQ7kNvgF9YJS2&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx&_nc_gid=AmQxc7dfMwmU4FBfk0SB-\nNJ&oh=00_AYB3QYyJB_2xiKp98sghgQ_lZFvkw9wHLsiFzPlRUnZVPA&oe=67657834)\n\nCombating Vaccine Misinformation\n\nWe are expanding our efforts to remove false claims on Facebook and Instagram\nabout COVID-19, COVID-19 vaccines and vaccines in general during the pandemic.\nToday, following consultations with leading health organizations, including\nthe WHO, we’re expanding the list of false claims we will remove to include\nadditional debunked claims about COVID-19 and vaccines.

We’re giving $120 million in ad credits\nto help health ministries, NGOs and UN agencies reach billions of people\naround the world with COVID-19 vaccine and preventive health information. And\nwe’re providing training and marketing support to help governments and health\norganizations move quickly and reach the right people with the latest vaccine\ninformation.\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr6-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/148330566_455905225452733_8692098461749135394_n.png?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=wAFtWiJFNiQQ7kNvgGLFXwR&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr6-1.xx&_nc_gid=AmQxc7dfMwmU4FBfk0SB-\nNJ&oh=00_AYC3uuSIEWbSvMohB7X6ZaM_BaGXLA4cP84ZmVeXj4rR6Q&oe=67659FA2)\n\nWe’ll soon bring the COVID-19 Information Center to Instagram so people can\naccess the latest information about COVID-19 vaccines across our apps. We’re\nalso helping health authorities and governments share timely vaccine\ninformation over WhatsApp and provide answers to people’s questions.\n\nWe’re also working to amplify content that directly serves communities where\nvaccine intent and access may be lower. In the US, we’re partnering with the\nJohns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health to reach Native American\ncommunities, Black communities and Latinx communities, among others, with\nscience and evidence-based content that addresses the questions and concerns\nthese communities have. We’re also working with AARP to reach Americans over\n50 with educational content about COVID-19 vaccines, including Spanish-\nlanguage content designed to reach Latinx and Hispanic communities.\n\nThis builds on the work we’ve done with health organizations over the past\nyear to increase adoption of COVID-19 preventive behaviors, such as wearing a\nmask. We put reminders at the top of Facebook and Instagram to wear a mask.\nAnd we reached over 26 million people with our public figure campaign\nencouraging people to #WearAMask, resulting in a 7-point increase in people\nreporting that wearing a mask in public is very or extremely important. We’ll\nuse insights and best practices from this work to inform vaccine information\ncampaigns and support health authorities in building confidence in COVID-19\nvaccines.\n\nProviding Data to Inform Effective Vaccine Delivery\n\nLast year, we began collaborating with Carnegie Mellon University Delphi\nResearch Group and the University of Maryland on COVID-19 surveys about\nsymptoms people are experiencing, mask wearing behaviors and access to care.\nThese surveys are conducted by our academic partners and Facebook does not\nreceive individual survey responses. With over 50 million responses to date,\nthe survey program is one of the largest ever conducted and has helped health\nresearchers better monitor and forecast the spread of COVID-19. It’s also the\nonly source of global data on mask wearing, which has helped public health\nofficials around the world in their COVID-19 response efforts. The Institute\nof Health Metrics and Evaluation used insights from the surveys to inform\nseveral mask mandates in countries such as Poland, which achieved a\nsignificant increase in mask wearing.\n\nData has proved critical in informing the fight against COVID-19. In 2020, we\nlaunched new datasets, maps and tools to support researchers, nonprofits and\ngovernments in their COVID-19 response, and in 2021, we’ll continue to provide\nhelpful data and insights to understand vaccine attitudes, build trust in\nvaccines through reliable information and support vaccination efforts.\n\nFor more information about how we’re providing data to aid in the fight\nagainst COVID-19, check out our [2020 Data for Good Annual\nReport](https://dataforgood.fb.com/docs/facebook-data-for-good-2020-annual-\nreport/).

As well as showing everyone on our platforms trusted\nvaccine information, we are focusing on how we can support you and your\ncommunities with steeper challenges to accessing COVID-19 vaccines. As\ngovernment organisations and health NGOS work to keep people safe and informed\nduring this pandemic, it is important for you to know some of the steps we've\nbeen taking:\n\n**Fundraising for global vaccine equity**\n\nMore than [700 million vaccine\ndoses](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.who.int%2Fdirector-\ngeneral%2Fspeeches%2Fdetail%2Fdirector-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-\nbriefing-on-\ncovid-19-9-april-2021&h=AT2aVxDoHB2MnX5lxpjFMN884y_1yg_E15GqwWOB1eCWtinYPGKYqX4vc8frZfdBS33bm2LaQPg-X0IvJ0KQHbn4YElJtNrti0NBbyf_lJ-5NajwbavD80Ygfd8311jWd2vW594dl4g9K9hRP0YdUsVg6ikXw3xX)\nhave been administered globally, but over 87% have gone to high-income or\nupper-middle-income countries. To help address this, Facebook is donating USD\n5 million to Go Give One, a COVID-19 fundraising campaign created by the World\nHealth Organization Foundation. The campaign calls on everyone to play their\npart in helping to vaccinate the world, with the money raised going to an\ninternational fund called COVAX (COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access). We'll do\nthis by donating the first USD 20 into Facebook Fundraisers created for the\nUnited Nations Foundation beginning 28 April in the United States, United\nKingdom, Germany and Norway. These fundraisers will support equitable vaccine\ndistribution around the world, reducing the spread of COVID-19 and putting\ncountries on a path to recovery.\n\n_\" You listened to the news and you saw on maps the places that had received\nthe vaccine and places that don't have the vaccine. And I must say, before\nthis, we were very frightened because we didn't have a clue what was going to\nhappen. Then the vaccine arrived and that has given us hope.\"_\n\n_– Alphonse Beckley after receiving the COVID-19 jab from a COVAX-supported\nclinic in Ghana_\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/178953651_1699053833600994_8983199700567576526_n.png?stp=dst-\nwebp&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=7785fb&_nc_ohc=PCPUs_JWmPIQ7kNvgE6KzIF&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx&_nc_gid=AqZbiMECu1nMCc-2oqqnDTk&oh=00_AYAc3CM1Zf80BqtGnGbkTAmrv9AxeHHz6i6nMbrUsEn8Rg&oe=67512F63)\n\n**Promoting reliable information**\n\nTo help us promote reliable vaccine information to communities with lower\naccess to vaccines, we will use the [CDC's Social Vulnerability\nIndex](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.atsdr.cdc.gov%2Fplaceandhealth%2Fsvi%2Ffact_sheet%2Ffact_sheet.html&h=AT3oQGaEgLiowfC4OSXBQj2tX3mLSIusYclOoSx2S0yE6VrO1FspF90DexQjJ2wMUHwcoG2XSAyOWe3C9o7RbBJJgisCQXvun2nMAZMc6STO950gaEDrR7e-JWZ-8DZygTJGnTai0J3wP2kSD2-xsK0tVc4un49h).*\nThis is a publicly available dataset that crisis and health responders often\nuse to identify communities most likely to need support, as higher\nvulnerability areas have had\n[lower](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fmmwr%2Fvolumes%2F70%2Fwr%2Fmm7012e1.htm&h=AT231TtwqcPNpIIEyWI0GCLjRkeFSlYYnNAdlhKPic5xb_ddXIt6m-6MyrDmUFSjuycbrp1Gfm_cAgLnaJfdfiPcUsVegZXpUbhsWvXC_cMRKmpJAf2CK1MP1sB8vBPR9Nfa1Us-\nssuQcIUDhNyC6ZoHwYaxtz4T) COVID-19 vaccination coverage. We'll show general\ninformation to everyone, but will promote it more frequently or prominently in\nNews Feed for people in lower-vaccination postcodes based on CDC data.\n\n_\" Facebook is taking a thoughtful approach to help public health leaders\nreach underserved communities with important information about the COVID-19\nvaccine based on CDC's tool. This supports our ongoing efforts to ensure all\nCalifornians have equitable access to the vaccine.\"_\n\n_– Dr Tomás Aragón, State Public Health Officer and Director of the California\nDepartment of Public Health_\n\n**Amplifying trusted messengers**\n\nIn countries where vaccines are becoming available to the general public,\nwe're focused on amplifying content from partners to help reach people most\naffected by COVID-19 and helping increase demand for COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nIn the US, we're working with partners such as Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF),\nBlackDoctor.org and the National Academy of Medicine to amplify content that\nfeatures black doctors, nurses and researchers answering common questions\nabout COVID-19 vaccines. And we're supporting AARP and Johns Hopkins\nUniversity's Bloomberg School of Public Health to run Spanish-language\ncampaigns about COVID-19 vaccines. We're also partnering with black-owned\nsocial enterprise [Broccoli City](https://www.facebook.com/BroccoliCity/) to\nhost a series of conversations on Facebook between black influencers, doctors\nand scientists on vaccine equity and the overall impact of COVID-19. This is\nan extension of our ongoing live series talking about COVID-19 vaccines with\ndiverse leaders on Facebook and Instagram, including transgender rights\nactivist [Elle Moxley](https://www.facebook.com/ellemoxleyofficial), ER doctor\nand health creator [Dr Mauricio\nGonzalez](https://www.facebook.com/drmauriciogonzalezarias/) and actress and\nTV host [Jacky Bracamontes](https://www.facebook.com/JackyBracamontes/).\n\nIn the UK, we are launching campaigns with Dope Black Dads, the British\nIslamic Medical Association and the Caribbean African Health Network that aim\nto get COVID-19 vaccine information to the communities at highest risk. We\nwill take a similar approach in other countries where vaccines are\nincreasingly available.\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/180178175_2810081405907779_2378628755984305226_n.png?stp=dst-\nwebp&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=7785fb&_nc_ohc=TgNN48gzCLEQ7kNvgFTje-Z&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx&_nc_gid=AqZbiMECu1nMCc-2oqqnDTk&oh=00_AYDel8lMz0FTJyars44g07gE1VnHK2Npjr_ATvG0VZLjZg&oe=675123DD)\n\n**Sharing insights and tools for equitable vaccine distribution**\n\nAccording to\n[research](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.fb.com%2Fvaccine-\nconfidence%2F&h=AT3e_5gnuiKxCzqMwmFdxhfBNvrDkLvsRCnWpQJmgj5rzkZp7kr6O7Ir2lte9khw5qo7Cfvjvg9wnCNDQJhkOp-\nkoERLdfUWGFlehoqZAiiLdL4JVcu0eKNIPvdzkmolUFo6k6Xn2_11oKFixsFuLTQ5KmcSbT7r) we\ndid in partnership with UNICEF, healthcare workers are the most trusted voices\nabout vaccines.

Our Community Standards and Community Guidelines define what is\nand isn't allowed on Facebook and Instagram, and our Community Standards and\nEnforcement Report tracks our progress and commitment to making Facebook and\nInstagram safe and inclusive.\n\nToday we’re publishing our Community Standards Enforcement Report (CSER) for\nthe first quarter of 2021. Some highlights of the report include:\n\n  * **A decrease in the prevalence of bad content:** Violent and graphic content prevalence was 0.03-0.04% on Facebook, down from 0.05% last quarter. Prevalence of Hate Speech also decreased from 0.07%-0.08% to 0.05-0.06%. These improvements in prevalence on Facebook are due to [changes we made](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.fb.com%2Fnews%2F2021%2F02%2Fcommunity-standards-enforcement-report-q4-2020%2F&h=AT3_1WD4cd4tZdlLgEIfIfdbxKAlnXBHvLD-8G_4I4rASniiisWAEkfNnAllebIRrOJrmxYYNlQ6YUq7g9oudGs95DeNVZYZQQKSZy4p_UdYYENKq_YnfaiREdTpVo9USwLD-dEpASmeK8QMGRS8NIJvTEJFw0IM) to reduce problematic content in News Feed.\n  * **Progress on hate speech:** Prevalence of hate speech on Facebook continues to decrease for the second quarter in a row. In Q1, it was 0.05-0.06%, or 5 to 6 views per 10,000 views. This improvement in prevalence on Facebook[ continues](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.fb.com%2Fnews%2F2021%2F02%2Fcommunity-standards-enforcement-report-q4-2020%2F&h=AT2gY84RC6mWsjDUi0dwhvmKoe8T02tVcglT3YHpTmj1fz12bA1rt0P2JKpJygyId6A2VjGq5vAoH4QUtRcoDaKvJi2pu5quGSDCyXjnV4speycUPv7e54X-eLtmVF0bE5lkxo2UdMK7eQFlC-6OLyMjZglYHQVX) to stem from changes we made to reduce problematic content in News Feed. On a quarterly basis, from Q1 2018 to Q1 2021, we have increased our content actioned by 10 times.

The three most popular ones I have seen going\naround are food, travel and anything motivation related. You go to chatGPT and\ntype in “give me a name for a Facebook page about x” where x is your niche.\n\n**The Process**\n\n  1. I decided to go with dessert. You then also ask chatGPT (or your AI of choice) for prompts to generate the content. Since I went with dessert, I asked it to generate dessert recipes. \n\n  2. You then copy these prompts into an image generator. The one I see recommended a lot and the one I used is Ideogram. They have a free plan that you can use for up to 20 photos a day. \n\n  3. The images it generated were actually not that bad. You take these images and then paste it on your Facebook page. \n\n**Results:**\n\nYou can make $500 a day!! Right? ..right? Absolute BS.\n\nIn my 7 days of posting I got 2 accounts reached 1 of which was my own. 0\nlikes and 0 comments even after following the EXACT template these creators\npush.\n\n**Interesting Findings:**\n\n  1. Literally everybody and their mom promoting this BS has a discord or course they are selling. Think about it: If it was so easy making 500 a day from Facebook why would they be willing to give the formula for THIRTY DOLLARS a month..you are a product. Be careful. \n\n  2. Even if miraculously you do get 10,000 followers you will not make money through the FB bonus program since it’s INVITE ONLY. You need to get invited and the process for that is very unclear, a fact conveniently left out by these creators. \n\n**How To Actually Make Money From Facebook**\n\nClaim you can make $500 a day on FB and make Youtube videos about it.\n\nLol in all seriousness don’t waste your time making low effort content it\ndoesn’t work unless you get very lucky. Or actually if you think I should try\nout something else let me know and I will.\n\nRead more\n\n**Top 1%** [ Rank by size\n](https://www.reddit.com/best/communities/5/#t5_2v763/)\n\nPublic\n\nAnyone can view, post, and comment to this community\n\n* &nbsp;\n\n* * *\n\n* TOPICS\n\n* Internet Culture (Viral)\n\n  * [ Amazing ](https://reddit.com/t/amazing/)\n  * [ Animals & Pets ](https://reddit.com/t/animals_and_pets/)\n  * [ Cringe & Facepalm ](https://reddit.com/t/cringe_and_facepalm/)\n  * [ Funny ](https://reddit.com/t/funny/)\n  * [ Interesting ](https://reddit.com/t/interesting/)\n  * [ Memes ](https://reddit.com/t/memes/)\n  * [ Oddly Satisfying ](https://reddit.com/t/oddly_satisfying/)\n  * [ Reddit Meta ](https://reddit.com/t/reddit_meta/)\n  * [ Wholesome & Heartwarming ](https://reddit.com/t/wholesome_and_heartwarming/)\n\n* Games\n\n  * [ Action Games ](https://reddit.com/t/action_games/)\n  * [ Adventure Games ](https://reddit.com/t/adventure_games/)\n  * [ Esports ](https://reddit.com/t/esports/)\n  * [ Gaming Consoles & Gear ](https://reddit.com/t/gaming_consoles_and_gear/)\n  * [ Gaming News & Discussion ](https://reddit.com/t/gaming_news_and_discussion/)\n  * [ Mobile Games ](https://reddit.com/t/mobile_games/)\n  * [ Other Games ](https://reddit.com/t/other_games/)\n  * [ Role-Playing Games ](https://reddit.com/t/role_playing_games/)\n  * [ Simulation Games ](https://reddit.com/t/simulation_games/)\n  * [ Sports & Racing Games ](https://reddit.com/t/sports_and_racing_games/)\n  * [ Strategy Games ](https://reddit.com/t/strategy_games/)\n  * [ Tabletop Games ](https://reddit.com/t/tabletop_games/)\n\n* Q&As\n\n  * [ Q&As ](https://reddit.com/t/q_and_as/)\n  * [ Stories & Confessions ](https://reddit.com/t/stories_and_confessions/)\n\n* Technology\n\n  * [ 3D Printing ](https://reddit.com/t/3d_printing/)\n  * [ Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning ](https://reddit.com/t/artificial_intelligence_and_machine_learning/)\n  * [ Computers & Hardware ](https://reddit.com/t/computers_and_hardware/)\n  * [ Consumer Electronics ](https://reddit.com/t/consumer_electronics/)\n  * [ DIY Electronics ](https://reddit.com/t/diy_electronics/)\n  * [ Programming ](https://reddit.com/t/programming/)\n  * [ Software & Apps ](https://reddit.com/t/software_and_apps/)\n  * [ Streaming Services ](https://reddit.com/t/streaming_services/)\n  * [ Tech News & Discussion ](https://reddit.com/t/tech_news_and_discussion/)\n  * [ Virtual & Augmented Reality ](https://reddit.com/t/virtual_and_augmented_reality/)\n\n* Pop Culture\n\n  * [ Celebrities ](https://reddit.com/t/celebrities/)\n  * [ Creators & Influencers ](https://reddit.com/t/creators_and_influencers/)\n  * [ Generations & Nostalgia ](https://reddit.com/t/generations_and_nostalgia/)\n  * [ Podcasts ](https://reddit.com/t/podcasts/)\n  * [ Streamers ](https://reddit.com/t/streamers/)\n  * [ Tarot & Astrology ](https://reddit.com/t/tarot_and_astrology/)\n\n* Movies & TV\n\n  * [ Action Movies & Series ](https://reddit.com/t/action_movies_and_series/)\n  * [ Animated Movies & Series ](https://reddit.com/t/animated_movies_and_series/)\n  * [ Comedy Movies & Series ](https://reddit.com/t/comedy_movies_and_series/)\n  * [ Crime, Mystery, & Thriller Movies & Series ](https://reddit.com/t/crime_mystery_and_thriller_movies_and_series/)\n  * [ Documentary Movies & Series ](https://reddit.com/t/documentary_movies_and_series/)\n  * [ Drama Movies & Series ](https://reddit.com/t/drama_movies_and_series/)\n  * [ Fantasy Movies & Series ](https://reddit.com/t/fantasy_movies_and_series/)\n  * [ Horror Movies & Series ](https://reddit.com/t/horror_movies_and_series/)\n  * [ Movie News & Discussion ](https://reddit.com/t/movie_news_and_discussion/)\n  * [ Reality TV ](https://reddit.com/t/reality_tv/)\n  * [ Romance Movies & Series ](https://reddit.com/t/romance_movies_and_series/)\n  * [ Sci-Fi Movies & Series ](https://reddit.com/t/scifi_movies_and_series/)\n  * [ Superhero Movies & Series ](https://reddit.com/t/superhero_movies_and_series/)\n  * [ TV News & Discussion ](https://reddit.com/t/tv_news_and_discussion/)\n\n* * *\n\n* RESOURCES\n\n* [ About Reddit ](https://www.redditinc.com)\n* [ Advertise ](https://accounts.reddit.com/adsregister?utm_source=web3x_consumer&utm_name=left_nav_cta)\n* [ Help ](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=footer&utm_campaign=evergreen)\n* [ Blog ](https://redditblog.com/)\n* [ Careers ](https://www.redditinc.com/careers)\n* [ Press ](https://www.redditinc.com/press)\n\n* * *\n\n* [ Communities ](https://www.reddit.com/best/communities/1/)\n* [ Best of Reddit ](https://www.reddit.com/posts/2024/global/)\n* [ Topics ](https://www.reddit.com/topics/a-1/)\n\n* * *\n\n* [ Content Policy ](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy)\n* [ Privacy Policy ](https://www.reddit.com/policies/privacy-policy)\n* [ User Agreement ](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement)\n\n[Reddit, Inc. © 2024.

are supporting government and charity organisations around the world to\nincrease confidence and provide accurate information about coronavirus\n(COVID-19) vaccines. Many of the organisations we support use [Brand Lift\nstudies\n](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1693381447650068?id=546437386202686)to\ndetermine if their campaigns influence perceptions around the safety and\nefficacy of vaccines. We recently completed an analysis of these Brand Lift\nStudies in order to identify best practices and characteristics of top-\nperforming content.\n\n**As you continue to communicate important information about COVID-19\nvaccinations and boosters, consider these six creative best practices to help\nyou have greater impact on your audience*:**\n\n**Feature trusted messengers:** Campaigns that feature trusted messengers are\nmore likely to resonate with audiences. Trusted messengers could vary by the\ntarget audience and may include health professionals, celebrities, community\nleaders or others. For example, [CARE\nUS](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.care.org%2Fnews-and-\nstories%2Fideas%2Fsocial-and-behavioral-change-communications-campaigns-to-\nreduce-vaccine-\nhesitancy%2F&h=AT3g2VahwAdPQc02NYzSXsvy5mS0-s9hBGkpyGfHYh1fTpa3Uzkb33VDF6tRW2hSlUoX5_F71FiVUl37hIZFRWcH00HQ5WnYVCkDHq0u6TCQ9VpK11Q2Nu9VQcUhfy7odl44AuYHNuV6gCft2k4CkEsPO6hcWK3b)\ndeveloped and tested assets that featured health workers, faith leaders and\ncelebrities to determine which messengers were most likely to influence their\ntarget audience.\n\n![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y4/r/-PAXP-deijE.gif)\n\nSomething went wrong\n\nWe're having trouble with playing this video.\n\n[Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/396404120401278/list)\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr6-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/73244193_459519834664888_7092065649463132160_n.png?stp=dst-\nwebp&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=7785fb&_nc_ohc=8CxwnRX5xUsQ7kNvgHnlUo0&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr6-2.xx&_nc_gid=APapXkpI4X4P_1hCsUaPPLl&oh=00_AYBKKjzaBAcGA1HAdj6UAII0XZALK4DeY4TAOOuvRP-6fw&oe=6751114A)\n\n**Engage audiences immediately:** Successful campaigns often start with a\nquestion or statement that immediately engages their audience, e.g. \"How do we\nknow the COVID vaccines are safe?\" Or, \"If I have had COVID, do I need to be\nvaccinated?\" Consider putting a question or key message at the beginning of a\nvideo to draw audiences in and use text overlay for static images. For\nexample, KFF's (Kaiser Family Foundation) [THE CONVERSATION / LA\nCONVERSACIÓN](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.greaterthancovid.org%2Ftheconversation%2F&h=AT0st98EIPobnPqA_Jzk-\nAnYzh8UxX1IOC9za0Gd4SxoJCqneITgnHCDB9VLAv8n6F7XjqjG9Btubm4inCRH_8L0jMkjLi4MjIltde80MtRpRCMj15qf1Lv-_0aK-7IUTOkaDg6O4jyaQyS6lJOEQto1PD4OFGKc)\nfeatures healthcare workers answering common questions about COVID-19\nvaccines.\n\n![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y4/r/-PAXP-deijE.gif)\n\nSomething went wrong\n\nWe're having trouble with playing this video.\n\n[Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/396404120401278/list)\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr6-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/73244193_459519834664888_7092065649463132160_n.png?stp=dst-\nwebp&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=7785fb&_nc_ohc=8CxwnRX5xUsQ7kNvgHnlUo0&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr6-2.xx&_nc_gid=APapXkpI4X4P_1hCsUaPPLl&oh=00_AYBKKjzaBAcGA1HAdj6UAII0XZALK4DeY4TAOOuvRP-6fw&oe=6751114A)\n\n**Hone in on a key topic and reflect this in your creative assets:** Our meta-\nanalysis showed that high-performing campaigns focused on one topic or, at\nmost, a few related ones (e.g. COVID-19 myth-busting). Therefore, consider\nfocusing on a specific topic or issue, rather than diluting messaging across\nmany different topics, which may confuse your audience. If you want to\ncommunicate a range of messages, consider splitting them across different ad\ncampaigns.\n\n**Balance video and static:** Our meta-analysis showed that campaigns that\ncombine video and static content tend to perform better than video-only\ncampaigns.\n\n**Simplify and shorten content:** We found that short videos are generally\nmore effective than longer ones. Campaigns with information that was easy to\nprocess and understand also performed better than highly technical content.\nFor example, [Direct\nRelief](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.directrelief.org%2F2021%2F09%2Fcovid-19-vaccine-\nacceptance-social-vulnerability-and-effective-message-design-in-the-\nus%2F&h=AT2-Dz-2h2gHxDHohbT5gdsTMEn5Cs3ycqRRM3GT75oG5XpmqbcfEsAIGmKUDMJsECihzLyswOlq_gEPPg1AH0A_UYq7_5oBYDWQQd3Ur3smDJu6Q7E3u8yNi-\nQiRa3F0wDYwMkpWE6F5u2MNlCAmcuiriwSBhEU) developed three short creatives to\nbuild confidence in vaccines, all of which were under 15 seconds in length.\n\n![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y4/r/-PAXP-deijE.gif)\n\nSomething went wrong\n\nWe're having trouble with playing this video.\n\n[Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/396404120401278/list)\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr6-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/73244193_459519834664888_7092065649463132160_n.png?stp=dst-\nwebp&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=7785fb&_nc_ohc=8CxwnRX5xUsQ7kNvgHnlUo0&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr6-2.xx&_nc_gid=APapXkpI4X4P_1hCsUaPPLl&oh=00_AYBKKjzaBAcGA1HAdj6UAII0XZALK4DeY4TAOOuvRP-6fw&oe=6751114A)\n\n**Mobile-optimised assets:** Our analysis showed that ads that were most\neffective for mobile viewing were those that were designed specifically for\nmobile, e.g. with sound off or cropped to fit a mobile screen. Ensure that all\nassets are [mobile-optimised](https://www.facebook.com/business/news/5-ways-\nto-optimize-your-ad-creative-for-mobile) to help capture attention and allow\neasy viewing on a mobile device.\n\nBearing these best practices in mind can help government and charity\norganisations develop more effective ads and connect more effectively with\ntheir audiences.

Each\nvideo in this series will break down a complex topic related to safety and\nintegrity on our platforms. In our first episode, we take a look at how\nFacebook is fighting COVID-19 vaccine misinformation.\n\n![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y4/r/-PAXP-deijE.gif)\n\nSomething went wrong\n\nWe're having trouble with playing this video.\n\n[Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/396404120401278/list)\n\nTo address the challenge of misinformation on our platforms, we’ve built a\nglobal network of more than 80 independent fact-checkers who review content in\nmore than 60 languages. And thanks to these significant investments in people\nand technology — like Artificial Intelligence — we’re making progress.  \n  \nSince the pandemic began, our AI systems have taken down COVID-19-related\nmaterial that global health experts have flagged as misinformation and then\ndetected copies when someone tries to share them. As a result, we’ve removed\nmore than 12 million pieces of content about COVID-19 and vaccines.  \n  \nBut it’s not enough to just limit misinformation that people might see. We\nalso connect people to reliable information from trusted experts. Through our\nCOVID-19 information center, notifications in people’s feeds on Facebook and\nInstagram, and through labels with reliable information from experts that we\nattach to certain posts, we’ve been able to help surface reliable information\nwhile reducing the visibility of misinformation. In fact, we know that when a\nwarning screen is placed on a post, 95% of the time people refrain from\nclicking it. And now with COVID-19 vaccines rolling out to people around the\nworld, we're driving a global campaign to help bring [50 million people a step\ncloser to getting COVID-19\nvaccines.](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.fb.com%2Fnews%2F2021%2F03%2Fmark-\nzuckerberg-announces-facebooks-plans-to-help-get-people-vaccinated-against-\ncovid-19%2F&h=AT3mPNWO9_JsrN7iqDFlLPw9X53d8vESGGGtbTILNIzzLXIt4LgKP-\nYys4IZ5A5N2VLwVpe6HskRUN0BM4VFux4Y95nNM9z3Oivin4jHU9HxvXEmo6U-2SFfh7xz8wB5FmQAyLYzBVRPxFNITx70lYf_c8m6BD5f)\n\nIn our next episode of Let Me Explain we’ll dive into how we develop our\n[Community Standards](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/) and where\nwe draw the line between freedom of expression and safety.

However, 95% among them had got to know their friends’ opinion\nthrough social media.\n\nSimilarly, 77.8% of those who were initially doubtful of the efficacy of\nvaccination and later overcame it had done so based on their observations on\nsocial media.\n\nThe effect of this virtual community may have a major impact on the formation\nof attitudes and any research which does not explicitly take it into\nconsideration may end-up underestimating the influence of social media in\nhealth information landscape.\n\nWhile almost all (98.2%) of those who regularly used social media used it to\nconsume information on current affairs only half (51.2%) were keen on using it\nas a platform to disseminate information. The importance of this is the fact\nthat much of the content circulated in social circuits are mostly disseminated\nthrough a group of people with a higher affinity towards sharing. If these\nnodes with a higher affinity for “content recirculation” could be identified\nthrough their social media behavior, targeting them with scientific content\ncould have a proportionally bigger impact on the information landscape.\n\nIn addition to this, factors like the level of trust in traditionally\nauthoritative figures when it comes to health communication such as Doctors,\nGovernmental Organizations, and International Non-Governmental Organizations\nseemed to be useful in predicting antivaccine sentiments. A deep neural\nnetwork trained with these datapoints in the limited sample, proved to be\nreasonably accurate (85%-90%) although a larger sample would be needed for\nbetter results.\n\nWith over 70% (71.7%) believing Government Health Institutions to be credible\nsources of health information, they play a major role in shaping public\nsentiments and beliefs. Therefore, empowering such institutions to reach the\nmasses through social media may have an enormous impact on the health\ninformation sphere of a community. The use of elements of virality such as\nsocial currency to optimize viral reach, seemed have paid rich dividends to\nthe Health Promotion Bureau (HPB) of Sri Lanka.

In\naddition to connecting people with reliable information about the pandemic and\nremoving more than 18 million pieces of content with claims about COVID-19 and\nvaccines that have been debunked by leading health organizations, our [third-\nparty fact-checking program](/journalismproject/programs/third-party-fact-\nchecking) is a key component of our multi-pronged approach. We know that\npeople experience misinformation differently based on where they are and what\nlanguage they speak, which is one reason the program has expanded to include\nfour partners who fact-check in Spanish in the US, and nine other Spanish-\nspeaking fact-checkers around the world. Working together, we’re running the\nlargest effort by a social media company to address Spanish-language\nmisinformation.\n\nIn total, the fact-checking program includes more than 80 organizations\nworking in more than 60 languages globally to identify, review and rate viral\nmisinformation across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. Below, some of these\nfact-checking organizations share how they’re fighting COVID-19 and vaccine\nmisinformation in Spanish on our platforms.\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr6-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/175380095_494024465061101_5974837486890949828_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=N7DnGLks5igQ7kNvgGMf69s&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr6-2.xx&_nc_gid=AjUJ7m0Ql-\nup21OSH_UjqVy&oh=00_AYCKzaj2kWhP86u2GiWeBafd_pOr2DnW9K120XHNVs3XYQ&oe=676585D2)\n\n##### **How does Spanish-language misinformation get fact-checked and\nlabeled?**\n\n  \n\nIn the same way English-language misinformation is fact-checked and labeled:\n\n  * Fact-checkers can identify hoaxes based on their own reporting, and Facebook also surfaces potential misinformation to fact-checkers using signals, such as feedback from our community or similarity detection. Our signals and machine learning are trained in Spanish for Spanish content.\n  * During major news events or for trending topics when speed is especially important, we use keyword detection to gather related content in one place, making it easy for fact-checkers to find. For example, we’ve used this feature to group content about COVID-19, global elections, natural disasters, conflicts and other events.\n  * Each time a fact-checker rates a piece of Spanish-language content as false on our platforms, we significantly reduce the content’s distribution so that fewer people see it. We also notify people who previously shared the content or try to share it that the information is false, and apply a warning label that links to the fact-checker’s article, disproving the claim with original reporting.\n  * [Facebook also uses AI](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/heres-how-were-using-ai-to-help-detect-misinformation/) to scale the work of fact-checkers by applying warning labels to duplicates of false claims, and reducing their distribution. If your language in the Facebook app is set to Spanish, you will see each of these labels in Spanish.\n\nWe know this program is working and people find value in the warning screens\nwe apply to content after a fact-checking partner has rated it. We surveyed\npeople who had seen these warning screens on-platform and found that 74% of\npeople thought they saw the right amount or were open to seeing more false\ninformation labels, with 63% of people thinking they were applied fairly.\n\n##### **How do fact-checkers debunk COVID-19 hoaxes?**\n\n  \n\n“To debunk or verify content, a large part of our work comes from extensive\nresearch and reaching out to experts in the fields related to the content\nwe’re fact-checking,” said Christina Anagnostopoulos, US editor for Reuters\nFact Check.\n\nFor example, when [a hoax cure for\nCOVID-19](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Farticle%2Fuk-\nfactcheck-espanol-covid19-vibraciones-\nidUSKBN28O21F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1ur1I1r3Y_7GAt0K_mj9L_-\npBPTOflKhapX3i076d-4JpJRpCrrnJhQ2c&h=AT3-pyYrqHDIbkjGLrYt-5ZtsVpST0eC9ev3wR3juRnEy3ZpMSdUHj3kGusbRF0evGOkQvOfD9MZmFHzcz0_7Yhs7bd-1SAv4-WnSBbWosO_3AaiQSkVYQaw2T7AO1McUNESMJQRwI9jpCn52OBOQ1mo809ymikV)\ngained traction in Spanish, Reuters fact-checkers interviewed physicists to\nexplain how the virus cannot be treated with body vibrations. In another\n[fact-\ncheck](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Farticle%2Ffactcheck-\nanthonyhopkins-vacuna%2Ffact-check-el-actor-britnico-anthony-hopkins-fue-\nvacunado-correctamente-contra-la-\ncovid-19-idUSL1N2LA1UB&h=AT0XQu8FcBeBuhbrYrQVkwCooJm2YQA9_bsLF6HgIKI31MQ-V-\nf_vpkZ762e6gcAAxLuNx9fwkfd_GSl5jhZaeLIYWIAl8XpU6GF4KwsXAdshhoqBgqBgMN208LvQfJXXCC5bcqHQZSUPaf4wSckAuP41eR1aXRZ),\nReuters examined multiple versions of a video that purportedly showed an actor\nbeing wrongly injected with the COVID-19 vaccine. Reuters contacted the Los\nAngeles medical center where the video took place and proved the vaccine was\nproperly administered.\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/178967195_470815730802776_4615803783335793697_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=F4P_IKmq39cQ7kNvgEcgFFz&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx&_nc_gid=AjUJ7m0Ql-\nup21OSH_UjqVy&oh=00_AYD6DXbRQZHjdAiSR6EZiuSSTtvsLrmLs0I6gqKTFVP8ig&oe=67657CA7)\n\n“Collaboration is the best weapon we have to combat false information,” said\nAbril Mulato, an AP fact-check editor based in Mexico City whose team\nregularly contacts reporters at other fact-checking organizations as part of\ntheir reporting process.\n\nTo debunk a [false\nclaim](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fapnews.com%2Farticle%2Fap-\nverifica-9883066345&h=AT1UCALId2QGe0pYX0jS25CoPDkF3jM5bP6phk5rq1bQdneoWpMZJkpuY06KlXIrEP9T20tp8mS2Px-\nXdzg31HXLzvZuH6688cPwrJVuV4EqvMtnxIEfyJ_8EXCFOTAjMvwets8XhNWoZa_CnSicMKMt4Y-vSA0g)\nabout the unsanitary transfer of COVID-19 vaccines in Argentina, for example,\nMulato’s team spoke with fact-checkers in Argentina. “Sometimes we’ll get help\ncontacting specific sources, which saves a lot of time. And sometimes when\nyou’re confused or a little bit stuck, sharing findings can help you see\nthings you wouldn't have noticed another way. That is priceless when you fact-\ncheck information,” Mulato said.\n\nThrough coalitions like the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN)’s\n[CoronaVirusFacts\nAlliance](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.poynter.org%2Fcoronavirusfactsalliance%2F&h=AT3l-FCK6nrxvmoyjnasMiKCdmacXloX2XYGhXilYt2jGS7GVGlUDKrGSTuJm4Z_4a_V3O4YW6MW26vfqTt1iQbyYpssxm7tdJFKDyxEQn53S43bjSfSIvIYzSUE0jeWyjBjkstEAAEaOevR6oGS3c5pyIiuCEmI),\nwhich was supported with funding from WhatsApp, fact-checkers collaborate to\nunderstand speeches or messages in a foreign language, contact experts or\nauthorities and better distribute fact-checks by sharing each other’s work.\n\n##### **How do fact-checkers fight Spanish-language misinformation in the\nUS?**\n\n  \n\nFactCheck.org is one of four US partners that fact-checks in Spanish and\nEnglish on our platform. In the fall of 2020 during the US presidential\nelection, with grant funding from WhatsApp, they partnered with Univision and\nthe International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) to distribute fact-checks in\nSpanish and English on FactCheck.org, Univision’s website and through [IFCN’s\nWhatsApp\nchatbot](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%2F%3Fphone%3D17272912606%26text%3Dhi%26app_absent%3D0&h=AT1P3vRivDvqohq7JmnFr54rVxldGWtNUlPhLu-\nqWJOx5yBddYHE409M7tCI5z0eFtkhsdbd2Kj43UTNgMy-\nAO5HVL56zBQ0rwQ40wCLR44035XdjMTjUbYKdzYl0-KRiCzPgltOuIPgevwj9gemsiiJBeIrqiTp).\n\nThis year, additional grant funding allowed FactCheck.org to expand its\nCOVID-19 misinformation coverage in both Spanish and English through hiring a\nbilingual reporter, contracting a translator and extending their partnership\nwith Univision.\n\n“It became increasingly clear that 2021 would be the year of the vaccine, and\nit would be important to get out accurate information about the COVID-19\nvaccines – especially to underserved communities that suffered\ndisproportionately during the pandemic,” said Eugene Kiely, director of\nFactCheck.org.\n\nIn the first few months of 2021, FactCheck.org’s bilingual reporter Catalina\nJaramillo helped produce more than two dozen fact-checks and\n[videos](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.factcheck.org%2F2021%2F02%2Fscicheck-\nvideo-the-facts-about-fauci-and-\nmasks%2F&h=AT2nF0RKPh8UrxaIUM-s34p4fXg2ntSu4MrOHF-\nIzxJPiRYnyM572p1t9pQAivhDtSMXG6JBPmWUThXyMUU1pj8UwlX0dnIBOduqVEkhNk2cUedFaYwYLv7EtwA3ctSkYTpLIK_4YYKZcwxadcqa7hi9szU2EIj3)\nin Spanish, including writing articles that debunked viral false claims about\n[vaccines causing\ninfertility](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.factcheck.org%2F2021%2F02%2Fscicheck-\nno-evidence-vaccines-impact-\nfertility%2F&h=AT2Iu_OBRe5sRJK8BbgNWj7C0AHd_d_CuZ5SvcLfT8-ivu77ejZC7b9EJenk0iO3uDlz-\ndncFjGkAmtxhOFKEcUj_Fc7Z_-8xQ5m_BqcA7UlQWiOkbGZ8XAf22GqaPUvVvZESeb8oHOBL9uklMzTSjU83CNnzwUE),\na [misrepresented CDC\nstudy](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.factcheck.org%2F2021%2F03%2Fscicheck-\nposts-distort-cdc-study-supporting-masks-mandates-to-reduce-\ncovid-19%2F&h=AT1Fi30eTW-\nVoy8ZKXDqK0VaVwN3qy6iCn9i7QrdUht5c52HsY9DSI-8C18qfvlMvJ966sirKMxNDbby-\nCdQipjX4rudVm6me0YIxnS8iwAwX0VgV88LVlNlOYAtUt9aCLgw0VnDLaVLma6YFvTMFWX77w5BmOjC)\non mask mandates and the\n[misuse](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.factcheck.org%2F2021%2F03%2Fscicheck-\nviral-posts-misuse-vaers-data-to-make-false-claims-about-\ncovid-19-vaccines%2F&h=AT2AeIL-TCD6Ni-\nYBHBzMSoCN79pL4REx0m15umW53NNTz55WrzVH7atQ-\neewGWeaNYPyXIKb_2A0PNOvhqo-4heJFHOoeN48M61-TA87jnfitL6Q7X_eUqHa5iddXQRkh9se2GBRhnxshub_A0CizkIQBWu2YFv)\nof government data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).\n\nIn some cases when content rated by Facebook’s third-party fact-checkers risks\ncontributing to imminent violence or physical harm, we remove that content\nunder our [COVID-19 and Vaccine\npolicies](https://www.internmc.facebook.com/help/230764881494641).\n\n##### **How do global fact-checking partners work together when COVID-19\nmisinformation crosses country borders?**\n\n  \n\n\"When a hoax has been identified by our colleagues in the US or Canada, we\nknow that there are big chances that it will end up being viral in Spanish\ntoo, so we proactively find out if the misinformation has already started\ncirculating in Spanish and tackle it as fast as we can,\" said Elodie Martinez,\nhead of fact-checking for AFP in Latin America and Spain, whose team also\nfact-checks Spanish content in the US.\n\nIn December 2020, AFP’s international fact-checking team helped refute false\nclaims spreading in\n[Spanish](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ffactual.afp.com%2Fla-\nenfermera-que-se-mareo-al-recibir-la-vacuna-contra-covid-19-en-eeuu-esta-viva-\ny-\nbien%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR10u2bljMCukwfqx_KoGFzz08tn9awtg_t8njqOMXMjS_g3KM-9j0YWChw&h=AT0rQfrs3SeYljDxfxFPAj8OcRcWn-\nMkFs8M7zu7AJc8L0YL0gRnmRHfEZdlSo_TdGScTznh0jTHAAvqzBrQ_isr_f4E1diroQ3q0nOlyLY8OSnYd617gjzlLtJLT3tRVY-\nJxprX27D0mQSvAxPPrbydTlU3Kl24) and other languages about one of the first\nAmerican nurses to receive the Pfizer vaccine.\n\nIn contrast, some false claims emerge in Spanish and are specific to a\ncountry’s political decisions, public policies and health emergencies,\nMartinez said. For example, when Mexico, Peru and Brazil faced a severe lack\nof oxygen for COVID-19 patients, AFP\n[debunked](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ffactcheck.afp.com%2Ffalse-\nlist-home-treatments-covid-19-circulates-online&h=AT0UPMhjF0Us32IEswy5uvhI-\nZnyz1bKVPOatZfnTcqcD-kyBHsqzQVAABev91rOJMV5KZKn-\nyv4wOGalRnXY8uVlB1QcIuGxmLYUoZ91N7_DH2RdrCBbS5FkntJp0-EShdj-h0g36az0XrHevharQER9m4J2w0-)\nrecommendations for creating dangerous homemade oxygen concentrators. \"The US\nwas not facing anything comparable,\" Martinez said.\n\n##### **How does Facebook take action based on partners’ fact-checks?**\n\n  \n\nBased on fact-checks written by our partners, Facebook has added warning\nlabels to more than 167 million pieces of COVID-19 content since the outset of\nthe pandemic.\n\nFact-checkers say their impact is felt even beyond the content they label. For\nexample, Mulato said she’s seen some people find AP’s fact-check articles\nindependently and share them on their own. In one instance, people shared an\nAP\n[article](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fapnews.com%2Farticle%2F8641400129&h=AT3yyytZcKkkkzaf8xcgOvTYqhJhz18c3wqJvtpuNd0II2v_S0HUCsmMdOp58VGm9cbrnS__m8t3adiy5OE1RcViMYNgzJ-\nLi4UyaBQvmxGvIT-BWsjEdv1zyqKZCXClZ59iGD_ETH0GJlwaUMwGaWPo82hVXTh3) debunking a\nphoto of a crowded Mexico City airport, clarifying that the image was being\nused out-of-context since it was taken before the pandemic. \"When people post\nour articles, it helps the fact-checks start to move on their own and it's\nreally satisfying,\" Mulato said.\n\n##### **How is Facebook supporting Spanish-language fact-checkers?**\n\n  \n\nEarly in 2020, as we saw COVID-19 spreading around the world, Facebook\nrecognized the need to provide additional support to fact-checkers who were\ngrappling with transitioning their teams to remote work and shifting editorial\npriorities to address an increasing number of hoaxes about the virus. In\nresponse, we launched a variety of grants and programs.\n\n  * Partnering with the IFCN, Facebook [launched](https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/coronavirus-grants-fact-checking) a $1 million emergency grant program to support fact-checkers tackling COVID-19.\n  * WhatsApp [invested](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.poynter.org%2Ffact-checking%2F2020%2Fifcn-receives-1-million-from-whatsapp-to-support-fact-checkers-on-the-coronavirus-battlefront%2F&h=AT0482CN28S8Z_VEyaxqrYNEEmr0RO5NPt9sKhTqVI7ZxyGf288ZKES3roqD2f9XHsETcQSgjgchAZEfQ2BUL1Esmb-jA6r5uJ264zue_jNFb5vUZD7nX-yrfeNlX_TrBju1DMONi61L8HuLiELVkT5ChfbV7roO) $1 million to support IFCN's CoronaVirusFacts Alliance, in which nearly 100 fact-checking organizations in more than 70 countries and 40 languages produced more than 11,000 fact-checks about the COVID-19 pandemic, according to IFCN. In early 2021, WhatsApp [followed up](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.poynter.org%2Ffact-checking%2F2021%2Fwhatsapp-and-the-ifcn-offer-a-financial-shot-in-the-arm-to-fact-checkers-fighting-vaccine-misinformation%2F&h=AT1DfEmi_PC0j1OwzkrmuE8VNRKqxqVvUjDHn5dil20LRCnBI096PaOsTJiKtYlH872jlOPfDtOVjJ1Lm3CaF3ycEXgKUc72fPqziRpsDWk_Sez7QzkB-6ppaXT13J2kJWvXtPpHY6P31iXKvL1GHtXF9Sh3k4F9) with an additional $500,000 in grant funding to support projects fighting vaccine misinformation.\n  * We also launched a year-long [health fellowship program](https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/programs/third-party-fact-checking/global-health-fellowship) to enable fact-checking organizations to gain training and increase capacity for debunking health hoaxes. The program includes two Spanish-speaking organizations.\n\n##### **What else is Facebook doing to combat COVID-19 and vaccine\nmisinformation in Spanish?**\n\n  \n\nSince the pandemic began, we have\n[removed](https://about.fb.com/news/2020/04/covid-19-misinfo-update/#removing-\nmore-false-claims) more than [18\nmillion](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/mark-zuckerberg-announces-\nfacebooks-plans-to-help-get-people-vaccinated-against-covid-19/) pieces of\ncontent on Facebook and Instagram with certain false claims about COVID-19 and\nvaccine that have been debunked by leading health organizations. We’re running\nthe largest [worldwide campaign](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/reaching-\nbillions-of-people-with-covid-19-vaccine-information/) to promote reliable\ninformation about COVID-19 vaccines and have helped more than 2 billion people\nconnect with resources from health authorities. We’re also [labeling\nposts](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/mark-zuckerberg-announces-facebooks-\nplans-to-help-get-people-vaccinated-against-covid-19/) about COVID-19 vaccines\nand vaccine safety to show additional information from the World Health\nOrganization. And we’re connecting Spanish-speaking communities with accurate\ninformation about COVID-19 through our [COVID-19 Information\nCenter](https://www.facebook.com/coronavirus_info/), available in 189\ncountries.\n\nInstruction\n\nDid you find this content helpful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\npage ID\n\ncms id for page\n\npage URL\n\nurl for page\n\n|  \n  \nDid you find this content helpful?\n\nYesNo\n\nInstruction\n\nWhy not?\n\npage ID\n\ncms id for page\n\npage URL\n\nurl for page\n\n|  \n  \nSubmit\n\nThank you for your feedback.\n\n#### MORE STORIES\n\n/5\n\n[![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y4/r/-PAXP-\ndeijE.gif)](/journalismproject)\n\nFollow Us\n\n[![](https://scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/93569222_649512569227352_8434766649185271808_n.svg?_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=JlSftqmk0FIQ7kNvgGfweML&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx&_nc_gid=AjUJ7m0Ql-\nup21OSH_UjqVy&oh=00_AYDHdkPY07XL5ZJeXq2pNU3EFqNwFkLyO7vBnLX43ezDPQ&oe=67658A59)](/fbjournalismproject/)\n\nThe Meta Journalism Project works with publishers around the world to\nstrengthen the connection between journalists and the communities they serve.\nIt also helps address the news industry's core business challenges, through\ntrainings, programs and partnerships.\n\nPrograms\n\n[Accelerator](/journalismproject/programs/accelerator)[Community\nNetwork](/journalismproject/programs/community-\nnetwork)[Grants](/journalismproject/programs/grants)[IG Local News\nFellowship](/journalismproject/programs/instagram-local-news-\nfellowship)[Third-Party Fact-Checking](/journalismproject/programs/third-\nparty-fact-checking)\n\nTools\n\nRegister\n\n[News Page Registration](/journalismproject/tools/news-page-registration)\n\nEngage\n\n[Groups](/journalismproject/tools/groups)[Video](/journalismproject/tools/video)\n\nMonetize\n\n[In-Stream Ads](/journalismproject/tools/video#video-monetization)[Instant\nArticles & Subscriptions](/journalismproject/tools/instantarticles-\nsubs)[Subscriber Acquisition](/journalismproject/tools/subscriber-\nacquisition)[Subscriber Retention](/journalismproject/tools/subscriber-\nretention)\n\nMeasure\n\n[CrowdTangle](/journalismproject/tools/crowdtangle)[Creator\nStudio](/journalismproject/tools/creator-studio)\n\n[Blog](/journalismproject/blog)\n\n[Learn](/journalismproject/learn)\n\n[Partnerships](/journalismproject/partnerships)\n\n[](/journalismproject)\n\nFollow Us\n\n[![](https://scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/93569222_649512569227352_8434766649185271808_n.svg?_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=JlSftqmk0FIQ7kNvgGfweML&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx&_nc_gid=AjUJ7m0Ql-\nup21OSH_UjqVy&oh=00_AYDHdkPY07XL5ZJeXq2pNU3EFqNwFkLyO7vBnLX43ezDPQ&oe=67658A59)](/fbjournalismproject/)\n\n[ © 2024 Meta ](https://www.facebook.com/)\n\n[Privacy\nPolicy](https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/)[Terms](/policies_center)[Cookies](https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies/)\n\n",

That’s why we have rules\nto determine what is and what isn’t allowed on our platforms.\n\nOver the years, we’ve made a number of changes to help ensure that communities\nare safe, civically-engaged, supportive, informed and inclusive. We have a\nmulti-faceted approach to safety that focuses on three key areas:\n\n  1. **Create a Safe and Welcoming Community** : Our goal is to protect people from harm and give them more control over their privacy, data and the content they see. We take our role in keeping harmful content off our platforms seriously and our [Community Standards](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/) outline what is and is not allowed on Facebook and Instagram. \n  2. **Maintain a High Quality Ecosystem** : We work to maintain a high-quality ecosystem of content, publishers and ads, including by setting standards like our [Partner Monetization Policies](/business/help/169845596919485?id=2520940424820218) and [Content Monetization Policies](/business/help/1348682518563619?id=2520940424820218). Only publishers that agree to comply with our [policies](/business/help/409950705796014?id=1769156093197771) can show ads. Advertisers continually request more controls and transparency into where ads have shown up and will show up. [Brand safety controls](/business/help/1926878614264962?id=1769156093197771) are available for placements within publisher content, such as in-stream, Instant Articles or Audience Network.\n  3. **Collaborate Proactively and Collectively with the Industry** : We work with industry bodies and other tech platforms to share knowledge, build consensus and help make all platforms safer for people and advertisers. As an example, we have come together through the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM), a global collaboration with agencies, media companies, platforms and industry associations, to continue to improve digital safety.\n\n### Our Commitments Going Forward\n\nSafety is essential to the advertiser community. We remain committed to\nauditing and providing more transparency on measurement of violations and\nthose controls we provide. We'll continue to add to this post as we announce\nupdates.

The project required extensive planning and a lot of hard work, but\nit also benefited from some innovative technology: the world’s most detailed\nand accurate map of the local populations, created with help from a team of\nartificial intelligence researchers and data scientists at Facebook, working\nin collaboration with Columbia University’s Center for International Earth\nScience Information Network\n([CIESIN](http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ciesin.org%2F&h=AT39Wwu7N9JKZ6Z6XrKNdno_VQECQLuL4p1ASpeKGUJorqySvhe5f-7aLFq-\nvPm3K5BSjbaypVRG4yOTUubQV119DIKhyvnYkhYQ_QqPIR3PDKERr-3gB8Tk15XjD6t49ELUncRpMrVV0bvLEMeZ_QC6dLrI-\nSXM)).\n\nRecommended Reading\n\n  * [Using AI to help increase blood donations](https://tech.facebook.com/artificial-intelligence/2019/3/using-ai-to-help-increase-blood-donations/)\n  * [New open source AI research tools could help accelerate MRI scans](https://tech.facebook.com/artificial-intelligence/2018/11/new-fastmri-open-source-ai-research-tools-from-facebook-and-nyu-school-of-medicine/)\n  * [Deep dive: A chat with diver and VR filmmaker Laura James](https://tech.facebook.com/reality-labs/2019/3/deep-dive-a-chat-with-diver-and-vr-filmmaker-laura-james/)\n\nTo generate these maps, a team of data scientists and AI researchers in the\nFacebook Boston office took a creative approach. They used publicly available\npopulation data and commercially available high-resolution satellite imagery,\nand then applied machine learning techniques to map hundreds of millions of\nstructures distributed across vast areas.\n\nDigital volunteers with the Missing Maps project — an initiative co-founded by\nthe American Red Cross — used these AI-powered maps to filter out the 97\npercent of the terrain in Malawi that is entirely uninhabited. Volunteers with\nMissing Maps, which is a collaborative effort by humanitarian organizations to\nmap parts of the world that are most exposed to natural disasters and other\ncrises — could then concentrate their efforts on mapping the remaining 3\npercent, knowing that they weren't overlooking any small, remote communities.\nWith guidance from the maps, Red Cross volunteers were able to locate\ncommunities so they could answer questions about the vaccination process and\naddress the concerns of those who otherwise might not have brought their\nchildren to be immunized.\n\n“Facebook’s high-resolution population maps have supported Humanitarian\nOpenStreetMap and Missing Maps’ mission of putting the world’s most at-risk\nplaces on the map,” says Tyler Radford, executive director of the Humanitarian\nOpenStreetMap Team, which participates in the Missing Maps project. “The maps\nfrom Facebook ensure we focus our volunteers’ time and resources on the places\nthey're most needed, improving the efficacy of our programs.”\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr8-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/271761660_947828542826675_985955457075362981_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f537c7&_nc_ohc=dNcL8Cs-\nrAEQ7kNvgFb3BAb&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-2.xx&_nc_gid=ASmReVZVyFV2n3QqZ-\ndzRAJ&oh=00_AYBG0NnmkmEH27D8tTlVS0QvMnxwWtd-YnwCc5cKnuGC_w&oe=67511C38)\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr8-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/271761660_947828542826675_985955457075362981_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f537c7&_nc_ohc=dNcL8Cs-\nrAEQ7kNvgFb3BAb&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-2.xx&_nc_gid=ASmReVZVyFV2n3QqZ-\ndzRAJ&oh=00_AYBG0NnmkmEH27D8tTlVS0QvMnxwWtd-YnwCc5cKnuGC_w&oe=67511C38)\n\n## Knowing exactly where help is needed\n\nLaura McGorman, a public policy manager at Facebook, says her previous work\nwith international development efforts convinced her that the mapping project\ncould have a significant impact in building partnerships with NGOs and relief\norganizations.\n\n“Having started my career at USAID working on malaria control, I have\nwitnessed firsthand the critical role that accurate data play in the\neffectiveness of humanitarian efforts,” she says. “What’s exciting about\nworking on projects like these at Facebook is that it provides an opportunity\nfor our company to contribute to these efforts through our expertise in data\nand machine learning, opening space for our partners to focus on service\ndelivery and impact.”\n\nThe Boston-based team uses advanced computer vision and machine learning\ntechniques to combine satellite imagery from Digital Globe with publicly\navailable population data to create detailed population density maps of\nAfrica.\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/271812196_440655647797562_2038353838717676031_n.gif?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f537c7&_nc_ohc=aTQH7GVZFWwQ7kNvgFZVZSX&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx&_nc_gid=ASmReVZVyFV2n3QqZ-\ndzRAJ&oh=00_AYC1yfcjZfMT_HOADpMZCFFWzC0Us8jZAREU4xA2P58a2A&oe=675112B5)\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/271812196_440655647797562_2038353838717676031_n.gif?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f537c7&_nc_ohc=aTQH7GVZFWwQ7kNvgFZVZSX&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx&_nc_gid=ASmReVZVyFV2n3QqZ-\ndzRAJ&oh=00_AYC1yfcjZfMT_HOADpMZCFFWzC0Us8jZAREU4xA2P58a2A&oe=675112B5)\n\nThe system first sets aside locations that couldn't contain a building. Then\nthe neural net ranks each remaining location according to the likelihood that\nit does contain a building. The high-ranking locations are shown here as blue\ndots. Each is assigned population from census data (show here as the glowing\nmap). Finally, we overlay our distributed population onto the locations on the\nmap. (Background image courtesy of DigitalGlobe.)\n\nFacebook started developing population density maps in 2016 to provide better\ntools to support connectivity efforts around the world. However, the team\nrealized these maps could also function as a powerful public good by helping\nwith public health, rural electrification, and disaster response. The project\nnow aims to keep adding new continents and countries.\n\nWhen former American Red Cross employee and Missing Maps co-founder Drishtie\nPatel joined Facebook in 2016 to work on this project, the two organizations\nrealized that Facebook could offer significant help to improve the efficiency\nof volunteer mapping for programs in the humanitarian sector.\n\nIn Tanzania, Facebook’s AI-powered maps helped kick-start efforts to bring\nrenewable electrification to rural areas. Fewer than one in three people in\nTanzania has access to electricity. There are considerable gaps in energy\nsupply to the rural population, making it difficult to supply power from one\ncentralized source. As part of the mini-grid component of the Scaling-Up\nRenewable Energy Program (SREP) funded program in Tanzania, the International\nFinance Corporation (IFC), in close collaboration with the Rural Energy Agency\n(REA) of Tanzania, commissioned a consortium including Humanitarian\nOpenStreetMap Team (HOT), Reiner Lemoine Institute (RLI) and INTEGRATION\nEnvironment and Energy on a project to better understand which locations would\nbenefit from decentralized energy solutions. This was achieved by combining\nour high-density population maps with detailed data on settlement locations\nand structures from OpenStreetMap.\n\nHumanitarian OpenStreetMap team personnel then traveled to villages identified\nas high priority and conducted surveys aimed at understanding the local\npopulations’ electricity needs. The results of these surveys were provided to\nagencies involved in rural electrification, helping mini-grid operators choose\nthe most appropriate locations to begin the work.\n\n## **A project that’s perfect for AI**\n\nHigh-resolution satellite imagery already exists for much of the world.\nHowever, prior to Facebook’s mapping project, it required countless hours of\ndigital volunteers' time to comb through millions of square miles of pictures\nto identify which contained a tiny town or remote village.\n\nThe Facebook team used AI to solve the problem. They took those commercially\navailable high-resolution satellite images and split them into millions of\nroughly 100-foot-by-100-foot squares — each just a little bigger than a\nbaseball diamond. They then worked with a team of experts to label examples\nthat could be used to teach our computer vision system to accurately recognize\nall the structures in those images. Because building styles can vary greatly\nfrom region to region, the labelers created separate training examples for\neach country in the project. They also reviewed the results to ensure\naccuracy.\n\nGiven the huge scale, it was important to create a system that could work\nefficiently. For Africa alone, for example, the system examined 11.5 billion\nindividual images to determine whether they contained a structure. Their\napproach found approximately 110 million structure locations in just a few\ndays.\n\nOnce the researchers had mapped the structures, they could then use public\ncensus data in order to accurately extrapolate the local population density.\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/271829545_894189014598204_7620979915925766594_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f537c7&_nc_ohc=t9hOJEpWSiUQ7kNvgFA_1JA&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx&_nc_gid=ASmReVZVyFV2n3QqZ-\ndzRAJ&oh=00_AYAKyDZOxFkFka0guftbW3lEDxQqbWrTCPk446ia3WldXQ&oe=675126A9)\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/271829545_894189014598204_7620979915925766594_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f537c7&_nc_ohc=t9hOJEpWSiUQ7kNvgFA_1JA&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx&_nc_gid=ASmReVZVyFV2n3QqZ-\ndzRAJ&oh=00_AYAKyDZOxFkFka0guftbW3lEDxQqbWrTCPk446ia3WldXQ&oe=675126A9)\n\n“With just the census data, the best you can do is assume that people live\neverywhere in the district – buildings, fields, and forests alike,” says James\nGill, a Facebook engineer who worked on the project. “But once you know the\nbuilding locations, you can skip the fields and forests and only allocate the\npopulation to the buildings. This gives you very detailed 30 meter by 30 meter\npopulation maps.\n\n“The satellite data for the world is 1.5 petabytes,” says Gill. That’s enough\nto fill more than 1,000 hard drives on a typical laptop. “How do you store\nthat, how do you move that around, how do you run models on that? Algorithms\ndesigned for single machines — or even small numbers of machines — don't work\nat this scale. We had to devise parallelized versions of these algorithms.\nThis allowed us to utilize Facebook's infrastructure for storage, transport,\nand compute. There are only a small number of companies that can do this at\nthis scale.”\n\n## **Responsible sharing**\n\nBuilding tools from satellite imagery and national census data shared with\nColumbia University's CIESEN allows Facebook researchers to share their data\nscience and compute power with the world. Sharing these products openly and\nresponsibly creates opportunities for the humanitarian sector to improve the\nhealth and safety of communities around the world. The methodology for these\nmaps was developed in close coordination with experts in geographic and\ndemographic data at Columbia University’s CIESEN, and we’ve worked closely\nwith partners like Humanitarian OpenStreetMap to make sure the maps are used\nto help humanitarian projects.\n\n“When I talked with humanitarian organizations about their technical\nchallenges, it became clear that obstacles that were insurmountable to them\ncould be done on Facebook infrastructure in a month,” says Gill. “By\nleveraging our skills and resources, we can provide groups like Humanitarian\nOpenStreetMap with the information that lets them focus on what they do best:\nhelping the world.”\n\n _For more on the technical work done to create these population density maps,\nread our companion blog post on the Facebook AI\nblog[here](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/mapping-the-world-to-help-aid-workers-\nwith-weakly-semi-supervised-learning/)._\n\nShare:Share to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare to EmailShare to\nCopy\n\n#### Artificial Intelligence\n\nMeta creates breakthrough technologies and advances AI to connect people to\nwhat matters and to help keep communities safe.\n\n##### [Meta AI Blog](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/)#####\n[Tools](https://ai.facebook.com/tools/#frameworks-and-tools)##### [Meta\nResearch](https://research.facebook.com/)\n\n![Meta](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/yW/r/spdxquBOYIe.svg)\n\nTech at Meta shares how Meta's innovative technology is connecting the world\ntoday and the steps we're taking now to help realize the full social potential\nof the metaverse in the future.\n\n###### Follow us\n\n  * [More about Meta on Facebook](https://facebook.com/Meta)\n  * [More about Meta on Instagram](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Finstagram.com%2FMeta&h=AT1ltHnNB4ry9fEjGfSF3tSanpANiqn2ivw3h7EOsZ70iPCuDAgCxZYLLQy7gdF-BVa8VsQLMcdrVNN4dq323k42lWteNsosbw6kJtj2GwLMFsRb55uxMVT1sB2ubzNcfKaACLCw5XrYVORUq8KFGLDV6zRkksoR)\n  * [More about Meta on Twitter](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FMeta&h=AT30peCvAHAuimFBi6oj4p_wUqWq0-nn-OJhepJusCfHJQrh1I8hu4liwu6UaQyIhM6_tGTXUW2InQSb6LGj7xxUhrpF0sCkTbYMRbihh2dMXgouQrrxfDzVnRxT2aXb0bOd7HLjZA8EKnXrXfh8DSQUpZpw7dJ_)\n  * [More about Meta on YouTube](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2FMeta&h=AT0ukpr1eAhyy2zyobvImxuww2L17gWIppug5omzUeXvrPW52bkOaQDSrdEt3sDieVlG6VdHhCkfTdSt4uAYoMcd5FxxF1BWmATWzo_L11hK6lwnc4eLrFDu9oZlsEWP-sLH3GfHYoiFUhFYoNs9sWAyRkVlCLV_)\n  * [More about Meta on LinkedIn](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Fmeta&h=AT0UmzlvdqU9BnINCEk-BSqj1CHnKrLPpM2ofSWQu7vLU7e-Zoo2nyR1CfYrPTNIEVSypuVvUt5auG5B_8P0Z3WWyygPi5Naxew0bHlp2nCgcsJvV6rX_190eoWJInSMiVQ84McIfGI1rDgjFdOeVQqPtIRykKBo)\n\n##### Research & Engineering\n\n  * [Engineering at Meta](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fengineering.fb.com%2F&h=AT2QmZM37GMt3XjsY0RDUfz0H6wI5As6spPbNHYoYgBxtBhS1gEfy02SHA8cjiZDPgcIu6gsHEV-wcrTkLyjI6rzdTvnKZjHGyC-O7M742STcmcFDIEYWc1hQgUpYCR2UlAe5i9gMgpGwmn6I66Yzm5a9Xl95pww)\n  * [Meta AI Blog](https://ai.facebook.com/blog)\n  * [Meta Research](https://research.facebook.com/)\n\n##### Developers\n\n  * [Oculus for Developers](https://developer.oculus.com/)\n  * [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/)\n\n##### News\n\n  * [Meta Newsroom](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsroom.fb.com%2F&h=AT1exfK6ZsgGZBgA1Bd6zhJYcN1nGXHVMw1ZGntzZ9zqCWhIPCkjhlUbX48up9BBD-Acozw_mK59P3TxeJPZ81zceHMjyAjVUQJBleCqR3-hoBF4Tjngsp3uyC8kpSZnSS4aEsEVfABz7ecJx-nMLFsvCWEijHYE)\n  * [Meta Quest Blog](https://www.oculus.com/blog/)\n\n##### More from Meta\n\n  * [Company Info](https://about.facebook.com/)\n  * [Careers](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacareers.com%2F&h=AT1OiFKGQdsq5TLDWlJDWGx6z0Faxga2CHPz-SGCHlSO-v_IkkptKjGdUbO68QcsYgbSCgTRDJ3SO0tF5aVJch_d80-UzoyqpUad5bahmg8RSiQv5ojAcu3sjGpjW1e2CvmLpgNVykN5yVQdZ8F5AG3uExWRZCkn)\n\n* * *\n\n© 2024 Meta\n\n  * [Terms](https://www.facebook.com/policies_center)\n  * [Privacy](https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy)\n  * [Cookies](https://www.facebook.com/help/cookies)\n  * [Help](https://www.facebook.com/help?ref=href005)\n\n",

year ago, coronavirus (COVID-19) was declared a public health emergency and\nsince then we've helped health authorities [_reach billions of\npeople_](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.fb.com%2Fnews%2F2021%2F02%2Freaching-\nbillions-of-people-with-covid-19-vaccine-\ninformation%2F&h=AT2nFluQEhdPqBXds4D-hVyK-56KRWcOhqFgWF-\nBZqIPLjcnZ6Zl1_P5r2GmMW8Q67JPH5ZfAQewG2KZp5BAiefbPALu32q0YobbDihezEMCAGb3LOpOSUNtfBuROD6WZv6ZICz3InARWQGA9cVZVsBXujbeYt72)\nwith accurate information and supported health and economic relief efforts.\nWe're also expanding our efforts to remove false claims on Facebook and\nInstagram about COVID-19, COVID-19 vaccines and vaccines in general during the\npandemic.\n\nPublic health officials agree that vaccines are important to keep people\nhealthy and safe. As government and charitable health organisations equip\npeople with authoritative information about the COVID-19 vaccine, here is what\nyou should know about our efforts and how they might affect your advertising\ncampaigns:\n\n**Enabling safe promotion of vaccine information**\n\nGiven the recent approval of COVID-19 vaccines, we want people to be able to\nsafely promote information about these vaccines on Facebook. We allow ads that\nhighlight the ability of a COVID-19 vaccine to prevent someone from\ncontracting the virus, as well as ads promoting ways to safely access a\nCOVID-19 vaccine.\n\nWe'll continue to prohibit content that tries to exploit the pandemic for\ncommercial gain. Ads or organic posts that promote the sale of a COVID-19\nvaccine, such as attempts to sell COVID-19 vaccine kits or expedited access to\nthe vaccine, will be rejected. We will also reject ads that claim the vaccine\nis a cure for the virus, including claims of 100% prevention or immunity.\n\n[_Learn more_](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/213593616543953) about\nour additional ad policies on information about COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n**Prohibiting ads that discourage people from getting a vaccine**\n\nWe have launched a [_new global\npolicy_](https://www.facebook.com/policies/ads/prohibited_content/vaccine_discouragement)\nthat prohibits ads discouraging people from getting vaccinated or claiming\nthat a vaccine is unsafe or dangerous.

During ad\nreview, we check an ad's images and videos, text and positioning, including\nthe Page name and content on an ad's landing page to determine if the ad falls\nwithin the scope of our ads about social issues, elections or politics policy\nand requires a disclaimer.\n\n**Ads regarding COVID-19**\n\nAds about COVID-19 are generally allowed, including ads that say things such\nas \"Make sure that you wash your hands often with soap\", \"Everyone can help\nprevent the spread of COVID-19\" or \"Practise social distancing and limit\ntravel\". Ads like these don't require a \"Paid for by\" disclaimer.\n\nHowever, if ads about COVID-19 include political or electoral content, or if\nthe content qualifies as a social issue ad (in certain countries), then _they\n'll_ require a \"Paid for by\" disclaimer:\n\n  * The name of a current political figure, including candidates for public office; or their image or politician's title (e.g. \"Governor\", \"MP\" or \"Minister\"). Political figures include officials appointed by politicians such as the Surgeon General.\n\n  * Advocacy for a politician or candidate.\n\n  * Advocacy for a political party.\n\n  * Advocacy for a change to law or policy.\n\n  * Advocacy for or against legislation such as regulations, decrees, executive orders and proclamations such as \"shelter-in-place\" and \"restricted travel\".\n\n  * Grassroots advocacy where there is a call to action to a person to contact an elected official or governing body to take a specific step or to sign a petition aimed at an elected official or governing body.\n\n  * Information about voting, such as when and where to vote, methods for voting etc.\n\n  * Advocacy for social issues, such as health or immigration, in a country where we have the issue ad policy in place. Including advocacy for legislation or government policies around vaccines (such as a COVID-19 vaccine or COVID-19 vaccine trials).\n\n**Common examples about politics:** \"Our business is closed due to\nCalifornia's 'shelter-in-place' order\" wouldn't require disclaimers because\nthe ad doesn't include advocacy, debate or discussion of the shelter-in-place\norder. \"Due to Governor Elisabeth Rose's announcement, our business is closed\"\nand \"California's Governor tells residents to stay home\" would both require a\ndisclaimer because they mention a politician or their title.\n\n**Prohibited ads**\n\nAt this time, we don't allow ads that promote medical supplies that guarantee\nprevention of the COVID-19 virus or create a sense of urgency (e.g. implying a\nlimited supply) regarding those products. We're also temporarily banning\nadvertisements and commerce listings that sell items that have been associated\nwith exploitative behaviour related to the pandemic, such as medical face\nmasks and COVID-19 test kits.

Even if the ad copy doesn't include content about\nsocial issues, elections or politics, would this ad be enforced?**\n\nYes. Our ad policy requires advertisers to complete authorisations and include\n\"Paid for by\" disclaimers on their ads, if among other things, the ad content\nincludes references to a candidate for public office.\n\nWe'd require a disclaimer if the Page name mentions a public figure (e.g.\n\"President\", \"Governor\", \"MP\" or \"Minister\"). Even if the ad copy isn't about\nissues, elections or politics but the Page name which the ad will be running\nfrom includes a reference to these politicians, it'd require a disclaimer\n(because the Page name is considered visible copy on the ad). However, we\nwouldn't require a disclaimer if the office itself was only used in the Page\nname (e.g. \"Ministry\", \"Congress\").\n\n**What parts of the ad and content is checked to confirm if it 's an issue\nad?**\n\nIn selected countries, our policy requires that any advertiser who wants to\nrun ads that discuss, debate or advocate for or against social issues,\nelections or politics must go through the authorisation process and have a\n\"Paid for by\" disclaimer. We check an ad's images and videos, text and\npositioning, including the Page name and content on an ad's landing page\nagainst our [Community Standards\n](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.meta.com%2Fpolicies%2Fcommunity-\nstandards&h=AT1bdWjldq1X-sWmR-\nooBZqKSyNYfw5HIN3XhbArXpwCXdUsj5NM3_p3dqMpDogohJffCYihDWB4P71udTJt0pUDK3z9W_ft7GRnArc-\njJ_OgsQhtOEGtSyVkBiHk0Kjsad-sXJM73xRg1wIbEfTJqd79vb6Mo8X) and [ Meta\nAdvertising Standards](https://www.facebook.com/policies/ads).\n\nAll ads are subject to our ad review system, which relies on automated, and in\nsome cases, manual review to check ads against these policies. This happens\nbefore ads begin running, but ads may also be re-reviewed after they've gone\nlive. In certain cases, if an ad about social issues, elections or politics is\nalready running and lacks a disclaimer, the ad may be reported by our\ncommunity or flagged by our systems for re-review. When we detect an ad that\nviolates our Advertising Standards, including lacking the proper authorisation\nor disclaimer, we disapprove it.\n\n**If I mention an issue in the ad or make a statement about a topic, will it\nbe enforced?**\n\nIt isn't our intention to enforce on ads that simply mention issues or a\nparticular topic. Our intention is to enforce if it's discussing, debating or\nadvocating for or against an issue.\n\nAll issue ads are subject to review and enforcement will be dependent on\nlanguage and content within the ad itself.\n\n**The actual name of my organisation is technically advocating for an issue\n(for example, \"Stop Ocean Pollution Co.\"). If the organisation name makes up\npart of the Page name or is included within the ad creative, is that also\nreviewed?**\n\nYes. If the company's actual name makes up the Page name or is part of the ad\ncreative and the company name includes advocacy for an issue (e.g. Save the\nPlanet Co.), given that the text is reviewed, the company name would also be\nreviewed against our policy.\n\n## Additional resources for authorisations and disclaimers\n\n  * Review the [Ads authorisations step-by-step guide (by country)](https://www.facebook.com/gpa/more-resources#tab-1-election-integrity-resources).\n\n  * Watch the [ tutorial videos (US only) ](https://www.facebook.com/business/m/one-sheeters/ads-authorization-resource-hub). \n\n[![Permalink](https://scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/312822980_514159970725133_4580543080689971667_n.png?stp=dst-\nwebp&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=7785fb&_nc_ohc=-yeBWSUcYHkQ7kNvgH35AJB&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx&_nc_gid=At5_EOIrnDn81FNQvQ2960O&oh=00_AYCmP7qBmJAxyVBn-a0APSJzvSY_eWkuKHGKYLlK-\nON_Qw&oe=6751129D)](/business/help/213593616543953?helpref=uf_permalink)[![Share](https://scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/313028904_814226353232962_2342736752051407991_n.png?stp=dst-\nwebp&_nc_cat=1&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=7785fb&_nc_ohc=YXpvz9kUO0kQ7kNvgG3rJT5&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx&_nc_gid=At5_EOIrnDn81FNQvQ2960O&oh=00_AYBxDegPziGCJhghFi5m8dETwHyAI0ClipNahuQzR6Ju7Q&oe=675108A0)](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbusiness.facebook.com%2Fbusiness%2Fhelp%2F213593616543953%2F)\n\nMore in this section: Ads\n\nBasics\n\n[About ads about social issues, elections or\npolitics](/business/help/167836590566506)[About social\nissues](/business/help/214754279118974)[Countries with ad transparency\ntools](/business/help/2150157295276323)[How these ads are reviewed (with\nexamples)](/business/help/313752069181919)[How disclaimers\nwork](/business/help/198009284345835)[About the Ad\nLibrary](/business/help/2405092116183307)\n\n[About ads about social issues, elections or\npolitics](/business/help/167836590566506)[About social\nissues](/business/help/214754279118974)[Countries with ad transparency\ntools](/business/help/2150157295276323)[How these ads are reviewed (with\nexamples)](/business/help/313752069181919)[How disclaimers\nwork](/business/help/198009284345835)[About the Ad\nLibrary](/business/help/2405092116183307)\n\nSet Up\n\n[Become authorised to run ads](/business/help/208949576550051)[Confirm\nidentity](/business/help/2992964394067299)[Create disclaimers and link ad\naccounts](/business/help/488070228549681)[Authorise Instagram\naccount](/business/help/1096686790667310)[Create ads about social issues,\nelections or politics](/business/help/544219649587656)\n\n[Become authorised to run ads](/business/help/208949576550051)[Confirm\nidentity](/business/help/2992964394067299)[Create disclaimers and link ad\naccounts](/business/help/488070228549681)[Authorise Instagram\naccount](/business/help/1096686790667310)[Create ads about social issues,\nelections or politics](/business/help/544219649587656)\n\nManage\n\n[Manage disclaimers](/business/help/609103326609944)[Manage ad\naccounts](/business/help/604962396762404)\n\n[Manage disclaimers](/business/help/609103326609944)[Manage ad\naccounts](/business/help/604962396762404)\n\nTroubleshoot\n\n[Email deliverability issues](/business/help/2250340991925386)[Phone call\nissues](/business/help/2402691880000148)[What to do if your government ID was\nrejected](/business/help/207274006754488)\n\n[Email deliverability issues](/business/help/2250340991925386)[Phone call\nissues](/business/help/2402691880000148)[What to do if your government ID was\nrejected](/business/help/207274006754488)\n\n[Back to Home](/business/help)\n\n## Get the latest updates from Meta for business.\n\nProvide your email address to receive the latest updates from Meta for\nbusiness, including news, events and product updates.\n\nBy submitting this form, you agree to receive marketing related electronic\ncommunications from Meta, including news, events, updates and promotional\nemails.
