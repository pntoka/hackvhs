Each\nvideo in this series will break down a complex topic related to safety and\nintegrity on our platforms. In our first episode, we take a look at how\nFacebook is fighting COVID-19 vaccine misinformation.\n\n![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y4/r/-PAXP-deijE.gif)\n\nSomething went wrong\n\nWe're having trouble with playing this video.\n\n[Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/396404120401278/list)\n\nTo address the challenge of misinformation on our platforms, we’ve built a\nglobal network of more than 80 independent fact-checkers who review content in\nmore than 60 languages. And thanks to these significant investments in people\nand technology — like Artificial Intelligence — we’re making progress.  \n  \nSince the pandemic began, our AI systems have taken down COVID-19-related\nmaterial that global health experts have flagged as misinformation and then\ndetected copies when someone tries to share them. As a result, we’ve removed\nmore than 12 million pieces of content about COVID-19 and vaccines.  \n  \nBut it’s not enough to just limit misinformation that people might see. We\nalso connect people to reliable information from trusted experts. Through our\nCOVID-19 information center, notifications in people’s feeds on Facebook and\nInstagram, and through labels with reliable information from experts that we\nattach to certain posts, we’ve been able to help surface reliable information\nwhile reducing the visibility of misinformation. In fact, we know that when a\nwarning screen is placed on a post, 95% of the time people refrain from\nclicking it. And now with COVID-19 vaccines rolling out to people around the\nworld, we're driving a global campaign to help bring [50 million people a step\ncloser to getting COVID-19\nvaccines.](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.fb.com%2Fnews%2F2021%2F03%2Fmark-\nzuckerberg-announces-facebooks-plans-to-help-get-people-vaccinated-against-\ncovid-19%2F&h=AT1hVpWD83KaBlAE63LTjdnKseNFk5O95alcrNhBzuQ7db62rFgQUKcWX-\nOLtiKbkSd6rKwGAgNaJSOHuqdV_SXl9c30FbIkXO_qNWaLAkBLynKl-\nSxQqd50VRYaJ4vYNJwVxar9wjoC2p_uker1YynIixivc7IY)\n\nIn our next episode of Let Me Explain we’ll dive into how we develop our\n[Community Standards](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/) and where\nwe draw the line between freedom of expression and safety.

Fuelled by rising incomes, this new middle-class\ncommunity across Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam\nwill approach 350 million people with a combined disposable income of USD 300\nbillion by 2022.1 The importance of this audience can no longer be ignored, or\nthe opportunity to understand the people in it better. In the past, some\nadvertisers may have overlooked these important consumers, thinking them slow\nto adopt digital platforms and tools simply because they were located far from\nbig cities. Today, we know this is a myth, as digital adoption and expansion\nin the top five Southeast Asian countries shows otherwise.\n\n### A Leapfrogging Economy2\n\n### Smartphones are everywhere\n\n![The use of smartphones](https://scontent-\nlhr8-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/49971298_951642875039463_2595793356558696448_n.svg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f537c7&_nc_ohc=SQys_CcBDnwQ7kNvgGVy-\nMV&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr8-2.xx&_nc_gid=AI4dfcPeP9vk3zS6kF8UJJM&oh=00_AYC934d6fuhbETc7ePZ2mWjRG5rVron_PvJALeC4mcLp9w&oe=67511BDC)\n\nSmartphone connections to total market population\n\n(ID, PH, VN, MY, TH)\n\n### Electronic payments are spreading fast\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr8-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/49786222_2113507262295909_5410421447241760768_n.svg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=DXYP7mz2ErcQ7kNvgG3wQuA&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr8-2.xx&_nc_gid=AI4dfcPeP9vk3zS6kF8UJJM&oh=00_AYAECieIJBNrhLtA_VQ9lPDiKO0HlC0hmYIcz_q7SlxOPA&oe=6765A62A)\n\n>USD 30BAmount forecasted for SEA mobile payments by 2022\n\n### Logistics investments are reflecting the e-commerce fast growth in the\nregion\n\n![Increase in e-commerce logistics](https://scontent-\nlhr6-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/49850707_758597014474809_4591009685087191040_n.svg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=f537c7&_nc_ohc=gRkuEHhIF-\nkQ7kNvgEWkpdG&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr6-1.xx&_nc_gid=AI4dfcPeP9vk3zS6kF8UJJM&oh=00_AYCHUpVibnekCH4ZvWJ3kj_lc1R9P7o7ZcQ-0ZKhs4iCpw&oe=67513B49)\n\nSEA E-commerce logistics spend by market\n\nTo help marketers gain a better understanding of this untapped market and\nrising consumer segment – who they are and the issues they face as they move\nforward balancing modernisation with respect for tradition – Facebook and Bain\n& Company worked with Quantum to conduct an extensive study in 16 non-capital\ncities across Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. The\nresearch was comprised of 160 face-to-face group interviews and 80 consumer\nethnographic immersions in June 2018, across five markets and covered a range\nof consumer behaviours and attitudes. Separately, Bain & Company conducted an\nonline survey of 4,745 digital consumers across Indonesia, Malaysia, the\nPhilippines, Thailand and Vietnam, which helped to provide more in-depth views\nof the emerging middle-class landscape of the top five Southeast Asian\ncountries.\n\nAs part of the research, we also spoke with 40 industry business leaders\nacross Southeast Asia and found that despite the fact that 77% recognised the\nemerging middle class as a driver of growth, only 15% of the leaders think\nthat their companies are ready to market to the emerging middle class, with\n60% stating that they lacked a clear marketing strategy.3\n\nBy increasing their digital footprint, members of this growing group widen\ntheir world view beyond the limits of work, neighbourhoods or traditional\nexpectations. They now enjoy a huge privilege that previous generations did\nnot: greater power to choose. They can choose the person they want to be, the\npeople they want to be with, the places they want to go and the passions they\nwant to follow. Business leaders looking to reach this hugely influential\ngroup can begin by understanding these four shifts.\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/49757678_2213256892246831_4615827466412359680_n.jpg?stp=dst-\nwebp&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=UQJ2HqnKdYQQ7kNvgH3o1QC&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx&_nc_gid=AI4dfcPeP9vk3zS6kF8UJJM&oh=00_AYD3kL_qXpOuxiWpefpMdg6m5yQqZExZAXRQMDpAoUY13g&oe=67659176)Power\nto define identities\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr8-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/49934362_302417287062947_7186430367333613568_n.jpg?stp=dst-\nwebp&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=IKUzFQ3iT_sQ7kNvgGUwXW2&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr8-2.xx&_nc_gid=AI4dfcPeP9vk3zS6kF8UJJM&oh=00_AYDyN1_XfhOjxy3-vMd9uy5lS5hx29NoL4001prUPRoTvg&oe=6765A847)Power\nto reach broader communities\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/49861555_760946797601455_1790601445142167552_n.jpg?stp=dst-\nwebp&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=dyhQQVdhDpUQ7kNvgGhhDSB&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx&_nc_gid=AI4dfcPeP9vk3zS6kF8UJJM&oh=00_AYCYXm4HWGIrrs-2rPTm3KbeEUDcqkML43GAL1dr-370BA&oe=676580C2)Power\nto pursue dreams and passions\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr8-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/49833001_280225026021406_1282535405622657024_n.jpg?stp=dst-\nwebp&_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=A9t3TUpF824Q7kNvgE0mtB7&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr8-2.xx&_nc_gid=AI4dfcPeP9vk3zS6kF8UJJM&oh=00_AYBw9T_ED0blX0LYmJGAsxbfBS3NOZPcqZ5tQ9wcS7vTIw&oe=6765A45B)Power\nto gain joyful experiences\n\n## [Download the full Facebook IQ\nreport](/business/f/2245379779017422/?file_name=southeast_asia_new_emerging_middle_class_inline_download&nav_ref=fb_for_business_responsive_link)\non Southeast Asia's emerging middle class and their digital journey.\n\n![Download the Facebook guide to automotive enthusiasts](https://scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/49901061_394284681399158_8987517103250604032_n.jpg?stp=dst-\nwebp&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=Cc0GF_9IBWUQ7kNvgF849UC&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx&_nc_gid=AI4dfcPeP9vk3zS6kF8UJJM&oh=00_AYD6a1jhhjo7cJmfW2utqpPU0vFzHhPXkf25C3SnphRTzw&oe=6765A9EC)\n\nThe power to define identities\n\n### The power to define identities\n\nToday's emerging middle-class consumers are able to define their own modern\nidentities through the power of digital connectivity, while still maintaining\nstrong ties to their traditional cultural backgrounds.

Much like boomers redefined retirement, Gen Xers are redefining middle\nage.\n\nThe critical reframe? Midlife doesn't have to be a crisis. It's more of a\nsecond adolescence – a middlescence – just with less awkwardness and more\nself-love. Midlifers are choosing to live this as a period of renewal and\nreassessment. On Facebook, conversation around **_middle age_** is very much\nalive, as people find inspiration in the way **_a rolling stone gathers no\nmoss_**.1 They are unlocking the power of **_self-reflection_** – and even\n**_Bodhipakkhiyādhammā_** (the qualities conducive to awakening) – with people\naged 35-54 overindexing on these discussions compared to younger generations.1\n\nIn search of balance and control in their lives, midlifers are reassessing\ntheir relationships and revitalising their careers and finances. They're\nexercising, socialising, adventuring and seeking new experiences, including\nholidays. In short, they're taking care of themselves – a strategy with\ndefinite staying power. As midlifers extend their timeline for becoming their\ntruest and best selves, expect to see an openness to new mindsets, habits and\nproducts as people look for guidance, understanding and acknowledgment,\nwhether from friends, creators or brands.\n\nRISING GLOBAL CONVERSATION TOPICS1\n\n _Midlifers (aged 35-54) are more likely than an average Facebook or Instagram\nuser to discuss

Although more than 5 billion people have received at least one dose\nof the COVID-19 vaccine worldwide, countries with weaker health systems and\nmultiple competing health challenges have limited capacity to roll out\nwidespread COVID-19 vaccination. These countries often have overstretched\nhealth workforces, limited investment in risk communication and community\nengagement, and challenges with vaccine hesitancy in some communities.\n\nOver the last year, Data for Good at Meta has been collaborating with UNICEF,\nthe Yale Institute for Global Health, and the Public Good Projects (PGP) to\ndevelop campaigns that drive COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Kenya, India,\nPakistan, and Ukraine, and that have reached more than 150 million people. In\ncelebration of World Immunization week, we analyzed the results of these\ncampaigns and are sharing lessons we learned about the most effective messages\nfor public health practitioners to learn from.\n\n## Campaign messages and content\n\nIn spring 2021, the Data for Good team at Meta worked to analyze [_public\nFacebook posts_](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/tools/insights-for-\nimpact) about the COVID-19 vaccine to understand drivers behind vaccine\nhesitancy being discussed on Facebook, as well as the main reasons for\nhesitancy from Facebook’s [_COVID Trends and Impact\nSurvey_](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/covid-\nsurvey/vaccines?location=USA&level=0) (CTIS). UNICEF, the Yale Institute for\nGlobal Health, and PGP assessed these insights and subsequently produced\nrelevant content for each country.\n\nAfter launching the campaigns via the relevant UNICEF country office page, we\nmeasured the effectiveness of different messages by comparing post-campaign\nsurvey responses of people who saw the ads with those of people who did not.\nThe survey asked respondents whether they remembered seeing the ad recently,\nas well as up to four other questions relating to awareness and attitudes\nabout the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n## What we learned\n\n### Providing practical information and answering common questions with\nlocally relevant content is critical\n\nAnalysis of public Facebook posts revealed that people had basic questions\nabout COVID-19 vaccine safety, efficacy, availability, and eligibility, with\nthe specifics of these concerns varying between countries. Survey data\nrevealed that in Kenya and Ukraine, concerns about potential side effects were\nthe main reason for hesitancy; however, in India and Pakistan, most people\nindicated that they wanted to wait and potentially get a vaccine at a later\ndate. In Ukraine, public posts also suggested that some people were interested\nin getting the vaccine but might need additional nudging to do so, and that\nmany people had lingering questions about safety and efficacy.\n\nFor each country, we worked to ensure that the campaign content reflected the\ncommunity’s main concerns and questions. In Ukraine, for example, the insights\nled to the development of two campaigns — one that provided information on\neligibility and how to register for the vaccine, and a second that focused on\nvaccine safety and efficacy. Similarly in Kenya, one campaign focused on\nproviding practical information to young adults stating that they were\neligible and that vaccines were freely available. Apart from the information\nin the ads themselves, all campaigns included links to government or UNICEF\nresource pages where people could click to read more about the vaccine or\nregister for an appointment.\n\nIn Ukraine, the campaign that provided information on eligibility and\nregistration succeeded in improving the likelihood that people would advise\ntheir friends to get vaccinated, and the safety and efficacy campaign\nincreased perceptions of vaccine importance. Similarly, in Kenya, the\npractical campaign was effective at improving perceptions of vaccine safety.\n\nIn India and Pakistan, content in local languages, rather than the national\nlanguage of English, also led to higher percentages of people clicking on the\nlinks to vaccine resource pages provided in the ads than the English content\ndid. This finding is helpful for settings where the assumption might be that\nonline populations will be more likely to engage in English content despite\nthere being large populations both online and offline that may be more\nattracted to content featured in languages such as Hindi and Urdu.\n\n### Values-based messaging and tapping into relevant social norms was an\neffective strategy\n\nExisting [_behavioral science\nresearch_](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41562-017-0256-5&h=AT0wGS5WDFM-\nLUjKQCvnLFXv9p4INIEWp6yRat7Qegrqptz98C613SPpmZolb0-Jmvsc9t6Aug5j3dLGSIbSfcw919UK5TdpO3FndvBquCFVRBEZNIHb1QUuOqf_OY7cGISFoJmML2qQ4kucvpvttflnFN1sVN0N)\nhas found a significant association between vaccine hesitancy and the\nupholding of certain moral values such as personal liberty and a belief in\npurity. Meanwhile, [_prior\nresearch_](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.sagepub.com%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1177%2F1069031X211073179&h=AT06q-dalCNLiAnGwGuWPfEoD3YlLuTYD320By6Qn0bABRSJJejyvxZPBtz8e1sK4BGuiSIULaDXrNBAZ7CDqk8g5K1_JJjf7Tg6jY6V3Ustg7Qyx8M4k0hEp9Cxf42RQor8kMuJ3ophi8t8MXGaCj3G7rsRWdj6)\nsuggests that leveraging local social norms such as collectivism and equity\ncan be powerful tools in influencing people’s likelihood to vaccinate.\n\nIn our public post analysis, Data for Good at Meta found discussion of moral\nvalues and social norms were common across countries. For example, when\nposting about vaccines in Ukraine, many people emphasized the right to choose\nwhether to vaccinate, suggesting that liberty is a core value of many\nUkranians. In India, however, many posts expressed pride that India had\nproduced its own vaccine and was distributing it to other countries at the\ntime. Meanwhile, in Pakistan, public posts about the vaccine discussed\nconcerns about inequity in vaccine access. Such values were leveraged in the\nmessaging content and creative design.\n\nAs a result of our pre-campaign research, UNICEF Ukraine ran messages\nemphasizing that vaccines are a personal choice that can lead to positive\noutcomes for individuals and their families, which worked well for improving\nperceptions that it was better to get vaccinated than to risk getting\nCOVID-19. Leveraging local insights in India, the team developed a campaign\nthat underscored collective action and used India-focused imagery, which\nperformed especially well at increasing the likelihood that the Hindi-speaking\naudience would advise a close friend or relative to get the COVID-19 vaccine.\nIn Pakistan, insights informed the development of a campaign focused on the\nvalues of fairness and equity that achieved the strong results across several\noutcomes tested in Pakistan and was particularly successful in improving\nperceptions of vaccine importance.\n\n### Storytelling and testimonials are powerful outreach tools\n\nExisting [_public\nhealth_](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fpii%2FS0264410X18306121%3Fvia%253Dihub&h=AT1zfS_hF3biBLaQWulj_HJGwlLau5KlWu0NR9TBe2dfXoiskYzhHHYqwD5tELrZ5mqCHyM_KSzdChKm5XOlxm4LcSribdu5N70Vy0LXYFES4cjB72rja4L5Ip9sCHpZ1I88E8Rn4Sn88GGKpb90a6GgtIFwtBZb)\nresearch has found approaches such as parental stories can be effective in\ngetting people to seek more information about vaccines, and UNICEF and Yale’s\n[_Vaccine Messaging\nGuide_](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unicef.org%2Fdocuments%2Fvaccine-\nmessaging-guide&h=AT1fJ16ZrXOgkXho0beoPX9u7Kg0joiDDZ9fxBSp4oA-\natybA93xDzM1F8591P3y4_rCqSMKbZd65cHivuBISi_vJY_yTtRaqeLbU1j_jbmKeo93Kbm3UpSflSwJCSdu77hEFUMV7whs8A_ahc-\nG_0vzyM-jCyAn) outlines that using narrative techniques can be a compelling\nmessaging strategy. In our own precampaign research, we found that many people\nin India shared on Facebook their personal stories of being vaccinated and\nencouraged others to do the same. In India, a high proportion of public posts\nalso showed appreciation for health-care workers. Meanwhile in Pakistan,\npublic posts revealed that many people were trying to register their parents\nand older relatives for a vaccine appointment, which offered an opportunity to\ntell locally relevant stories about young people working to protect elderly\nmembers of their families.\n\nIn India, our findings prompted the development of testimonial-style\nillustrative content featuring health-care workers, and in Pakistan, the\nresulting campaign featured everyday people expressing their eagerness to do\ntheir part and get vaccinated, as well as to register loved ones, including\nolder relatives, to do the same. In India, the storytelling campaign was\nparticularly effective for improving perceptions of social approval of the\nvaccine and the likelihood that people would recommend the vaccine to their\nfriends. Similarly, in Pakistan, the testimonial campaign was effective for\nimproving the likelihood that people would recommend getting the vaccine to\nclose friends and relatives.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nAcross four countries and over 150 million people reached, results from our\ncampaigns on the COVID-19 vaccine suggest that filling gaps in basic\ninformation, developing messages that speak to relevant values and social\nnorms, and leveraging techniques like testimonials and storytelling with\neffective messengers can all be powerful tools in combating vaccine hesitancy.\n\nAlthough these findings represent a substantial step forward in understanding\nhow to increase vaccine acceptance through digital outreach, this research and\nmessage testing represents the first phase of this collaboration between\nUNICEF, the Yale Institute for Global Health, PGP, and Meta. Currently, we are\nconducting randomized control trials in India, Pakistan, and Ukraine to test\nwhether these digital campaigns lead to improved vaccine confidence and higher\nimmunization rates overall, which will further illuminate the role that\ndigital campaigns can play in advancing global public health goals.\n\nSpecial thanks to Surangani Abeyesekera, Social and Behavior Change\nSpecialist, Demand for Immunization at UNICEF HQ, as well as Dr. Saad Omer,\nSarah Christie, Amyn Malik, and Scott Bokemper from Yale Institute for Global\nHealth for their contributions to this research.\n\n**Areas**\n\n[Data Science](/research-area/data-science/)\n\n**Tags**\n\n[Data for Good](/tag/data-for-good/)\n\n**Share**\n\n  * Copy URL \n  * [ Share on Twitter ](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2F&h=AT2kQGDcPa0zUzQJCbVzcFnP29gcdFs2DYldOsoC-ZXhMa7XFQdJgFUUVeWdM_deUB8r8c_t8IlGF11PXPQ4NGtrPtJNbhW_en6GG-gZ9JIvny49tvxX1TW2pCfvaeJctRO8c7lAUvpH6NBHLTumvWyqp8YzdPrr)\n  * [ Share on Facebook ](https://facebook.com/)\n\n* * *\n\n## Featured News\n\n[All News](/blog/)\n\n![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y4/r/-PAXP-deijE.gif)\n\nMay 17, 2023\n\n### [How generational differences affect consumer attitudes towards\nads](https://research.facebook.com/blog/2023/5/how-generational-differences-\naffect-consumer-attitudes-towards-ads/)\n\n![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y4/r/-PAXP-deijE.gif)\n\nApril 17, 2023\n\n### [Every tree counts](https://research.facebook.com/blog/2023/4/every-tree-\ncounts-large-scale-mapping-of-canopy-height-at-the-resolution-of-individual-\ntrees/)\n\n![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y4/r/-PAXP-deijE.gif)\n\nApril 14, 2023\n\n### [How a non-traditional background led to cutting-edge XR\ntech](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacareers.com%2Flife%2Fhow-\na-non-traditional-background-led-to-cutting-edge-xr-\ntech&h=AT0ldTdsca7e9Urzgg5BZ7hjOI3wlhA-\nwuJmOM8ftGwm_JKUgAdjB2GMXlwXRq7fMdjclBb9919_yjUrzVcpeyyeXcFWz4ZkUmrqVaVhPaY2XYskkS9VmG7DKjuZBxL8o9y84V4IS2nLdLB0JBzZ_kuvpNT5VHcq)\n\n[Meta\nCareers](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacareers.com%2Flife%2Fhow-\na-non-traditional-background-led-to-cutting-edge-xr-\ntech&h=AT0EvKd0IiHqf5OPRpDUo0KQzmEP_joniN5N3-TUhKGoLXfIg7TAV4iFJqhP_t-\nzy4au7EbNzw8GVSq6viILQVfLbWtiGknbc1WcUzq84Twnf687re1NeZKDpRVlcIMlCdqK_1BrxTkMCakRB0lmgXi9143HAFmk)\n\n[![Meta](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/yJ/r/C1E_YZIckM5.svg)](https://research.facebook.com/)\n\nSearchSubmit\n\n## Meta Research\n\n  * [Publications](/publications)\n  * [Requests for Proposals](/research-awards)\n  * [RFP Funding Recipients](/research-award-recipients)\n  * [Fellows](/fellows)\n  * [Datasets](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ffort.fb.com%2Fresearcher-datasets&h=AT1XNE7GFy27UZXb6aqY-TuX5b5DtFnb8X8h-GJQDqGVRJzcsvE_T53H46t5wAEfFY1YBa40MSIaV2tvBVjUXui5r6uSFpR2Dax5Fs811lEo373M76eAmGveboKN35sakPq5ZCYQSvgsLGE-iifs-yVUZFKlQ75v)\n  * [Careers](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacareers.com%2Fareas-of-work%2Fresearch%2F%3Fp%5Bteams%5D%5B0%5D%3DResearch%26teams%5B0%5D%3DResearch&h=AT2iawZfuUmVn9VvEHMAvbg8t7zyFPxA5VWxoz0YdaqYSsSgm8ESRcl_wlLec2zEqKWQdhK2SU6nUkqIFLQ8jzWfrWyg2bu1x4MwhksviKNMsfQVcKkP_lEdMVwJ2VUUQV4W7pTS_vaZ1JY4XcNzDSjs4O8iElZS)\n\n## Visit Our Other Blogs\n\n  * [Blog](/blog)\n  * [Engineering](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fengineering.fb.com%2F&h=AT3kJKJV5ry9ZC5Kw7sAiSc05YSF4aHFWYdI7qVSjvqWdxc_IdNh102kmTD2KvyDu8K2EKcD3BYR4SiEmrrrrSGXro49Oeb3YsmjBEpCBU8G2DQupcPgN8iwKtPbCoW1cEgJA-5rIC8dLJpJKBWXMuzW59Z1VG4p)\n  * [Meta AI](http://ai.facebook.com/)\n  * [Meta Quest](https://oculus.com/blog/)\n  * [Tech at Meta](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.fb.com%2F&h=AT1f1LvurQxVSKOD1ksK4HCmgcZ6jXEga9Xt3EXVs7YxBN3IfcHiFucZdOlnKF7hoHzt9M0Kzv8eHdkVQqWdZHqfY_m8QqUPmNudy9PPl0_Lk7VSVWzkPch96twfPogLiMcSJzN2nx10EUGWG_I3zdFHbWEblRQQ)\n\n  * [RSS Feed](https://research.facebook.com/feed/)\n  * [About](https://about.facebook.com/)\n  * [Careers](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacareers.com%2F&h=AT0p5U8-VbGEXYced0Ppua2gRaCgCbzPL8wl3b6GNXobZMslrVFnKNoXW2r7S5MO_LtSotY-MnhvDH_ArNBwdr3FtcRluHCpm9Qk1cKGvLxr9IIF6PcLMH9KGDp-tctA5yrzzSalJmSKVGOilyobzcrd0uZOrK_G)\n  * [Privacy](https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/)\n  * [Cookies](https://www.facebook.com/policy/cookies/)\n  * [Terms](https://www.facebook.com/policies_center)\n  * [Help](https://www.facebook.com/help)\n\nMeta © 2024\n\n",

We also invest significant resources to support fact-checkers during\nmoments of crises and [war](https://about.fb.com/news/2022/02/metas-ongoing-\nefforts-regarding-russias-invasion-of-ukraine/).\n\n##### **Fighting health misinformation**\n\nSince early 2020, Meta has prioritized providing additional support and\nresources to fact-checkers grappling with an increasing number of hoaxes about\nCOVID-19 as well as misinformation related to vaccines. In response:\n\n  * We [launched](https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/coronavirus-grants-fact-checking) a $1 million emergency grant program to support fact-checkers tackling COVID-19, in partnership with the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN). \n  * We [launched](https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/programs/third-party-fact-checking/global-health-fellowship) a year-long health fellowship program with 10 fact-checking organizations that are part of our fact-checking program, to bring on new team members to help them combat health misinformation. Participating organizations represented countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. Together, [these organizations built new products and systems](https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/global-health-fellows-reflect-fact-checking-misinformation) to better address health misinformation. \n  * WhatsApp [invested](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.poynter.org%2Ffact-checking%2F2020%2Fifcn-receives-1-million-from-whatsapp-to-support-fact-checkers-on-the-coronavirus-battlefront%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2HH_FHhgNzAHnRVuEnNCxc4z_I1ZLcnGiadnokVgD8XjIGbAdGP44r9co&h=AT1Rk_NALqQAUqM6UGQsER8Ak4xlZ_3Ykuhz4yTmyQILN4jZW7_SycTkC_kQ91cF1lsSAEk5jRbgA0qfn4LiphFEKRQGYVdNMKa7SgfJ3b3G788wati8ip1fk-u2_jCM9j0k3rQ6W_iaXKrYXDrjEFuRK5eGFHIEJCVs1Y_2q-wLlA) $1 million to support IFCN's COVID-19 efforts, including the CoronaVirusFacts Alliance, in which nearly 100 fact-checking organizations in more than 70 countries produced more than 11,000 fact-checks about the COVID-19 pandemic in 40 languages, according to data collected by the IFCN. As part of this, WhatsApp also [launched](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.poynter.org%2Ffact-checking%2F2020%2Fifcn-receives-1-million-from-whatsapp-to-support-fact-checkers-on-the-coronavirus-battlefront%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2HH_FHhgNzAHnRVuEnNCxc4z_I1ZLcnGiadnokVgD8XjIGbAdGP44r9co&h=AT0kt6U-jKDjlZuEQvrZ4EWI3wzvDNcq8RUXg_0RK1NL8bgk_Yw8toqdt1opjwVSO9IOK_3GYWmuH9tuGoT8ZOpNLq2IctcZNptXignPDtY-gss19LdoaQMjLyu7KAunlqCm7ZCoZuLtEzHOPZ6LTw2fDrP4pChNoIuQnd8ZrZpzpw) a $500,000 grant program to support seven fact-checking organizations’ projects fighting vaccine misinformation, in partnership with the IFCN. \n  * We [launched](https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/facebook-partners-with-meedan-digital-health-lab-to-help-fact-checkers-debunk-health-misinformation) a partnership with the Digital Health Lab at Meedan, a global technology nonprofit, to support fact-checkers in fighting health misinformation online. Meedan’s Digital Health Lab facilitated a series of virtual training sessions between its team of doctors, scientists and health experts and Meta’s [third-party fact-checking partners](https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/programs/third-party-fact-checking/partner-map).\n\n##### **Investing in innovation, collaboration and the future of fact-\nchecking**\n\nMeta has funded programs that foster innovation, support industry\ncollaboration and increase diversity within the fact-checking industry.\n\n  * We [launched](https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/climate-misinformation-grant) the Climate Misinformation Grant in partnership with the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN). As part of our $1 million investment, this initiative offers funding to organizations working to combat climate misinformation and is structured to allow for collaborative partnerships between fact-checkers, climate experts and other organizations. \n  * We launched an [Accelerator Challenge](https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/accelerator-fact-checkers) that brought fact-checking organizations together to innovate, learn from experts and one another, and collaborate on new strategies to grow and expand their reach so that more people are connected to reliable information. Participating publishers in the training program, which was led by expert coaches at Blue Engine Collaborative, reported significant increases in audience growth as a result of the lessons learned during the program. \n  * We partnered with [IFCN](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.poynter.org%2Fifcn%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2_UNm1u3kDYOgFhYXQ7fp1dhAHaM9AIYNctmNYoo-KX3wmmx811hPPnxk&h=AT0Wzecs79-v7i3Oq2cTjNu90Q4vrEYFQvjpNgXJPDSCrxq-EWRL6FcVewOosHLSCzJxXMsQZcuUp_5MZKDrg5ItulvyQO-0nklmsaPV2AOYX87BoKoHRjsRBYsixDKnBx4i71Y9E0ROERvTubAowHqZoAyNmQrx) to launch a [Global Fact-Checking Mentorship Program](https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/third-party-fact-checking/global-mentorship-program-fight-misinformation) to help fact-checkers scale their fact-checking efforts and increase their capacity to detect and debunk misinformation online. Meta will award a total of $450,000, to be administered by IFCN, for selected mentors to develop a mentorship curriculum for the mentee organizations. \n  * We funded a year-long [fact-checking fellowship](https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/programs/third-party-fact-checking/nabj-fellowship) in the US with the National Association of Black Journalists, empowering fact-checking organizations to recruit [emerging journalists](https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/2021-nabj-fellowship-program).\n  * We launched the [Fact-Checking Innovation Initiative](https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/programs/third-party-fact-checking/global-health-fellowship) in partnership with the IFCN to support fact-checkers creating new formats and technologies to benefit the fact-checking ecosystem at large.\n\n##### **Supporting election integrity around the world**\n\nMeta has provided funding support to help fact-checkers increase their\ncapacity to promote reliable information ahead of 2022 elections in various\ncountries, including [Australia](https://australia.fb.com/post/how-meta-is-\npreparing-for-the-2022-australian-election/),\n[France](https://about.fb.com/fr/news/2022/02/elections-francaises-2022-une-\nserie-dinitiatives-dediees-sur-facebook-instagram-et-whatsapp-pour-aider-les-\ncitoyens-a-lire-et-a-decrypter-linformation-en-ligne/),\n[India](https://about.fb.com/news/2022/02/how-meta-is-prepared-to-protect-the-\nupcoming-state-elections-in-india/) and other countries around the world.\n\nWe recognize that strong partnerships and sharing expert information on best\npractices and approaches play a big role in effectively addressing\nmisinformation. That’s why we have also funded programs to facilitate\ncollaboration among fact-checkers, including supporting fact-checkers and\njournalism organizations to form [fact-checking\nconsortia](https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/third-party-fact-\nchecking/latin-american-consortia?locale=hr_HR): virtual assemblies of\njournalists and independent fact-checkers who join forces to help debunk\nmisinformation in the [run-up to\nelections](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rappler.com%2Fnewsbreak%2Ffact-\ncheck%2F223179-tsek-ph-project-newsrooms-universities-fact-check-\nclaims%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR05LavuyITb_TYkTJH1ShpAGUm_k-1DoBxEUArL6Y0_A7lm54hZPXzh9Ks&h=AT1CklJ_yGMIXtCwwPssGMCaoQKkk2b8xZ5YdarPEd42jcsnquwXvLT82gRqqsl52g_GuBIMRaq5mcx-3dC4X89qWkv8hbufjEZHMml1kRRnD-78kSH1G2vQlk20WlyjcdPziC8qEYU4uq8NM9P3FVn_nyAOhsLR).\n\nFor more information about how fact-checkers work with Meta to reduce the\nspread of viral misinformation, visit [FB.me/Third-Party-Fact-\nChecking](https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/programs/third-party-\nfact-checking).\n\nInstruction\n\nDid you find this content helpful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\npage ID\n\ncms id for page\n\npage URL\n\nurl for page\n\n|  \n  \nDid you find this content helpful?\n\nYesNo\n\nInstruction\n\nWhy not?\n\npage ID\n\ncms id for page\n\npage URL\n\nurl for page\n\n|  \n  \nSubmit\n\nThank you for your feedback.\n\n#### MORE STORIES\n\n/5\n\n[![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y4/r/-PAXP-\ndeijE.gif)](https://about.fb.com/)\n\nFollow us\n\n[![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y4/r/-PAXP-\ndeijE.gif)](https://www.facebook.com/MetaforMedia/)\n\nSites\n\n[Meta Audience Network](/audiencenetwork)[Meta for Business](/business)[Meta\nfor Creators](/creators)[Meta Elevate](/fbelevate)[Facebook\nGaming](/fbgaminghome/)[Meta Journalism Project](/formedia/mjp)\n\nResources\n\n[Social editorial calendar](/formedia/social-editorial-calendar)[Media\nAcademy](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fformedia.facebookblueprint.com%2Fstudent%2Fcatalog&h=AT1DknhRY6xVXJN-\nqOBTQcUq0xrZa6nMnWGSQY7s3SbB5zh8j8QhrGCnNKDHVmlsaFZPGeHg9YFibyvPO6LfNrcXXMeXvEO5hH30V-hVFIP9rR5E4ndo0tZdTDSXWGD8lLWvoXuXzIPYFBlchesrhkDZ7D79eOAp)[Media\nSupport Portal](https://business.facebook.com/help/media)[Help Centre](/help)\n\n[Blog](/formedia/blog)\n\n[![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y4/r/-PAXP-\ndeijE.gif)](https://about.fb.com/)\n\nFollow us\n\n[![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y4/r/-PAXP-\ndeijE.gif)](https://www.facebook.com/MetaforMedia)\n\n[ © 2024 Meta ](https://www.facebook.com/)\n\n[Privacy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation)[Terms](https://www.facebook.com/policies)[Cookies](https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies/)\n\n",

Starting this week in the US, we’ll feature links in the COVID-19\nInformation Center to local ministry of health websites to help people\nunderstand whether they’re eligible to get vaccinated and how to do so. And in\nthe coming weeks, as more information becomes available, we’ll continue to\nexpand this feature to more countries and improve it to make it easier for\npeople to see where and when they can get vaccinated in just a few taps.\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/147785107_226181862520432_1748998116551951255_n.png?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=Jw2Y9jfOk9AQ7kNvgF9YJS2&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx&_nc_gid=ACkEQ1pFyiwIVWO4EQtZ-\nrz&oh=00_AYBgTYAR6R5i3oBZigl_GMTL1F1Hbh4yUupWPUA7B__ozA&oe=67657834)\n\nCombating Vaccine Misinformation\n\nWe are expanding our efforts to remove false claims on Facebook and Instagram\nabout COVID-19, COVID-19 vaccines and vaccines in general during the pandemic.\nToday, following consultations with leading health organizations, including\nthe WHO, we’re expanding the list of false claims we will remove to include\nadditional debunked claims about COVID-19 and vaccines.

We’re giving $120 million in ad credits\nto help health ministries, NGOs and UN agencies reach billions of people\naround the world with COVID-19 vaccine and preventive health information. And\nwe’re providing training and marketing support to help governments and health\norganizations move quickly and reach the right people with the latest vaccine\ninformation.\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr6-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/148330566_455905225452733_8692098461749135394_n.png?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=wAFtWiJFNiQQ7kNvgGLFXwR&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr6-1.xx&_nc_gid=ACkEQ1pFyiwIVWO4EQtZ-\nrz&oh=00_AYDPcD9YbogiU5QJdYnMFxrQ0w-NRvt6DIHemWn4SNBLWg&oe=67659FA2)\n\nWe’ll soon bring the COVID-19 Information Center to Instagram so people can\naccess the latest information about COVID-19 vaccines across our apps. We’re\nalso helping health authorities and governments share timely vaccine\ninformation over WhatsApp and provide answers to people’s questions.\n\nWe’re also working to amplify content that directly serves communities where\nvaccine intent and access may be lower. In the US, we’re partnering with the\nJohns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health to reach Native American\ncommunities, Black communities and Latinx communities, among others, with\nscience and evidence-based content that addresses the questions and concerns\nthese communities have. We’re also working with AARP to reach Americans over\n50 with educational content about COVID-19 vaccines, including Spanish-\nlanguage content designed to reach Latinx and Hispanic communities.\n\nThis builds on the work we’ve done with health organizations over the past\nyear to increase adoption of COVID-19 preventive behaviors, such as wearing a\nmask. We put reminders at the top of Facebook and Instagram to wear a mask.\nAnd we reached over 26 million people with our public figure campaign\nencouraging people to #WearAMask, resulting in a 7-point increase in people\nreporting that wearing a mask in public is very or extremely important. We’ll\nuse insights and best practices from this work to inform vaccine information\ncampaigns and support health authorities in building confidence in COVID-19\nvaccines.\n\nProviding Data to Inform Effective Vaccine Delivery\n\nLast year, we began collaborating with Carnegie Mellon University Delphi\nResearch Group and the University of Maryland on COVID-19 surveys about\nsymptoms people are experiencing, mask wearing behaviors and access to care.\nThese surveys are conducted by our academic partners and Facebook does not\nreceive individual survey responses. With over 50 million responses to date,\nthe survey program is one of the largest ever conducted and has helped health\nresearchers better monitor and forecast the spread of COVID-19. It’s also the\nonly source of global data on mask wearing, which has helped public health\nofficials around the world in their COVID-19 response efforts. The Institute\nof Health Metrics and Evaluation used insights from the surveys to inform\nseveral mask mandates in countries such as Poland, which achieved a\nsignificant increase in mask wearing.\n\nData has proved critical in informing the fight against COVID-19. In 2020, we\nlaunched new datasets, maps and tools to support researchers, nonprofits and\ngovernments in their COVID-19 response, and in 2021, we’ll continue to provide\nhelpful data and insights to understand vaccine attitudes, build trust in\nvaccines through reliable information and support vaccination efforts.\n\nFor more information about how we’re providing data to aid in the fight\nagainst COVID-19, check out our [2020 Data for Good Annual\nReport](https://dataforgood.fb.com/docs/facebook-data-for-good-2020-annual-\nreport/).

As well as showing everyone on our platforms trusted\nvaccine information, we are focusing on how we can support you and your\ncommunities with steeper challenges to accessing COVID-19 vaccines. As\ngovernment organisations and health NGOS work to keep people safe and informed\nduring this pandemic, it is important for you to know some of the steps we've\nbeen taking:\n\n**Fundraising for global vaccine equity**\n\nMore than [700 million vaccine\ndoses](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.who.int%2Fdirector-\ngeneral%2Fspeeches%2Fdetail%2Fdirector-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-\nbriefing-on-\ncovid-19-9-april-2021&h=AT3E_WQiKVQe8E3S20UykuWiMokzzKWrbDAR7QRe_g5tHjpVAebD0wQdaK0v5-pHTnjb7DwS87OAZ1alsO-\nyILOoWVv_QxigHQH-ePJ8g4gj4ZNmrPtaqRriL6pIx-QUReqomcgzoObv3w82sGlD3BugHBmHDXln)\nhave been administered globally, but over 87% have gone to high-income or\nupper-middle-income countries. To help address this, Facebook is donating USD\n5 million to Go Give One, a COVID-19 fundraising campaign created by the World\nHealth Organization Foundation. The campaign calls on everyone to play their\npart in helping to vaccinate the world, with the money raised going to an\ninternational fund called COVAX (COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access). We'll do\nthis by donating the first USD 20 into Facebook Fundraisers created for the\nUnited Nations Foundation beginning 28 April in the United States, United\nKingdom, Germany and Norway. These fundraisers will support equitable vaccine\ndistribution around the world, reducing the spread of COVID-19 and putting\ncountries on a path to recovery.\n\n_\" You listened to the news and you saw on maps the places that had received\nthe vaccine and places that don't have the vaccine. And I must say, before\nthis, we were very frightened because we didn't have a clue what was going to\nhappen. Then the vaccine arrived and that has given us hope.\"_\n\n_– Alphonse Beckley after receiving the COVID-19 jab from a COVAX-supported\nclinic in Ghana_\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/178953651_1699053833600994_8983199700567576526_n.png?stp=dst-\nwebp&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=7785fb&_nc_ohc=PCPUs_JWmPIQ7kNvgE6KzIF&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx&_nc_gid=AU-\ndBn1-SW3p6w7RsUgEffY&oh=00_AYCUvprgN7V6pzQRig6UkevWCUHtd2h2LylrP9ZdWlRkXg&oe=67512F63)\n\n**Promoting reliable information**\n\nTo help us promote reliable vaccine information to communities with lower\naccess to vaccines, we will use the [CDC's Social Vulnerability\nIndex](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.atsdr.cdc.gov%2Fplaceandhealth%2Fsvi%2Ffact_sheet%2Ffact_sheet.html&h=AT1ZWRePkYwR4hQhDV09UJ0_svh1t9y57ym5V0ATWvyxohpMxjmdx9At3JkpjcztUk2CsboZ98I0aY9Kwj7_zQoCLXr9hNXvRm_2UivvCR3ERU9pHDdIjjMEidzJ_FL5dHEJs31iGVlday36rWhMDrs0qAyqsOMw).*\nThis is a publicly available dataset that crisis and health responders often\nuse to identify communities most likely to need support, as higher\nvulnerability areas have had\n[lower](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fmmwr%2Fvolumes%2F70%2Fwr%2Fmm7012e1.htm&h=AT3vVaOGG_6n8bt6Fj8OPAsv2K-1lOYI67aecJu34_1gg6NKoihT5Od6dQE55FrC9NVndEqyALabneC_QUGFCjGSzbloIJhcT50BWq-6IMu2MCH3V7wIQVcShROT8yxtBjfLuj2B1zF4l5Wi_hioKBtt2YTVgmK5)\nCOVID-19 vaccination coverage. We'll show general information to everyone, but\nwill promote it more frequently or prominently in News Feed for people in\nlower-vaccination postcodes based on CDC data.\n\n_\" Facebook is taking a thoughtful approach to help public health leaders\nreach underserved communities with important information about the COVID-19\nvaccine based on CDC's tool. This supports our ongoing efforts to ensure all\nCalifornians have equitable access to the vaccine.\"_\n\n_– Dr Tomás Aragón, State Public Health Officer and Director of the California\nDepartment of Public Health_\n\n**Amplifying trusted messengers**\n\nIn countries where vaccines are becoming available to the general public,\nwe're focused on amplifying content from partners to help reach people most\naffected by COVID-19 and helping increase demand for COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nIn the US, we're working with partners such as Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF),\nBlackDoctor.org and the National Academy of Medicine to amplify content that\nfeatures black doctors, nurses and researchers answering common questions\nabout COVID-19 vaccines. And we're supporting AARP and Johns Hopkins\nUniversity's Bloomberg School of Public Health to run Spanish-language\ncampaigns about COVID-19 vaccines. We're also partnering with black-owned\nsocial enterprise [Broccoli City](https://www.facebook.com/BroccoliCity/) to\nhost a series of conversations on Facebook between black influencers, doctors\nand scientists on vaccine equity and the overall impact of COVID-19. This is\nan extension of our ongoing live series talking about COVID-19 vaccines with\ndiverse leaders on Facebook and Instagram, including transgender rights\nactivist [Elle Moxley](https://www.facebook.com/ellemoxleyofficial), ER doctor\nand health creator [Dr Mauricio\nGonzalez](https://www.facebook.com/drmauriciogonzalezarias/) and actress and\nTV host [Jacky Bracamontes](https://www.facebook.com/JackyBracamontes/).\n\nIn the UK, we are launching campaigns with Dope Black Dads, the British\nIslamic Medical Association and the Caribbean African Health Network that aim\nto get COVID-19 vaccine information to the communities at highest risk. We\nwill take a similar approach in other countries where vaccines are\nincreasingly available.\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/180178175_2810081405907779_2378628755984305226_n.png?stp=dst-\nwebp&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=7785fb&_nc_ohc=TgNN48gzCLEQ7kNvgFTje-Z&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx&_nc_gid=AU-\ndBn1-SW3p6w7RsUgEffY&oh=00_AYDmrzgNpvRzFP6ulV_lulKNrSeJZG_BnoxC0BCqnshv3Q&oe=675123DD)\n\n**Sharing insights and tools for equitable vaccine distribution**\n\nAccording to\n[research](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.fb.com%2Fvaccine-\nconfidence%2F&h=AT1O6e1RB9ZMn_JcttXM5eGuuu32pgfNIwRgwE7C45CEMIGcQfES30f2GUTqjIP9d9PEF4CSia9CgGvHmSs6OdXYOHvxEHgN5wSf3AdnIrVgzUmWxlADeFDIlSGZ1bynzxZXzdR1HGc0-FOyp_y4r2yJunr-06E-)\nwe did in partnership with UNICEF, healthcare workers are the most trusted\nvoices about vaccines.

Our Community Standards and Community Guidelines define what is\nand isn't allowed on Facebook and Instagram, and our Community Standards and\nEnforcement Report tracks our progress and commitment to making Facebook and\nInstagram safe and inclusive.\n\nToday we’re publishing our Community Standards Enforcement Report (CSER) for\nthe first quarter of 2021. Some highlights of the report include:\n\n  * **A decrease in the prevalence of bad content:** Violent and graphic content prevalence was 0.03-0.04% on Facebook, down from 0.05% last quarter. Prevalence of Hate Speech also decreased from 0.07%-0.08% to 0.05-0.06%. These improvements in prevalence on Facebook are due to [changes we made](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.fb.com%2Fnews%2F2021%2F02%2Fcommunity-standards-enforcement-report-q4-2020%2F&h=AT2RbIxaYrEta-HLWN1xI_lo4Nz5DLQ3Ee6oZSl5VjaGmNBzKSjFr1P4Cnn1NcSasVvSQW8qYTaNtmD1LbZLLr7ZGYMPankP9FEFD9rlS-o953z0WffKY_ht_s5vsq9vj4HQJm8SWKiSA1_yQ-Df8HGpRcgwE5fS7P2DmPZQAMZ_EQ) to reduce problematic content in News Feed.\n  * **Progress on hate speech:** Prevalence of hate speech on Facebook continues to decrease for the second quarter in a row. In Q1, it was 0.05-0.06%, or 5 to 6 views per 10,000 views. This improvement in prevalence on Facebook[ continues](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.fb.com%2Fnews%2F2021%2F02%2Fcommunity-standards-enforcement-report-q4-2020%2F&h=AT2VSO_F5D3CqmbTsbZiIRD2jaMMmnpHBKZyDWM5VNZ6T1K9tpHJZFV0aeV5koZprJqwzGztDRSSCWrVJUL7Z2MzVbRDM3TsI05r0Jxf2XSz2aZjTk3gPGft1HU5HbGYb-YLeoyKUkDSZ5yX-1fZJzb-SitXhrRP) to stem from changes we made to reduce problematic content in News Feed. On a quarterly basis, from Q1 2018 to Q1 2021, we have increased our content actioned by 10 times. Since we have been reporting it, we have increased our proactive rate from 24% to 97%.\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr6-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/185544204_2965470547023283_6148241142822299935_n.png?stp=dst-\nwebp&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=7785fb&_nc_ohc=fFQ1yAL6vEQQ7kNvgEc9G_N&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr6-2.xx&_nc_gid=ARGVcuAkHZnXcK6G0DbecKG&oh=00_AYDIP1dCA10c0m-ZPYjSSd89o2JhvJM3WzLNW_FxDs7g_g&oe=6751155C)\n\nRead on for highlights from the report, which include topics like: Independent\nOversight, COVID-19 Vaccines and Misinformation, and News Feed Controls.

Independent audits and\nassessments are crucial to hold us accountable and help us do better.\n\nHere are some ways we’re staying accountable:\n\n  * We worked with [international experts](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flaw.yale.edu%2Fyls-today%2Fnews%2Ffacebook-data-transparency-advisory-group-releases-final-report&h=AT0Mg6Pvr5su_m1Jd9RMoYIhKUZQkWsavaY5eG8IrrKUjd-K2BN2mtIb0ZF1fIGcmZ5RO1sGEblebEpgQZpFgeEnsSzur-mEdb_wUbXa-7RBB2nJ9NKi3l6ryyKetn34BFKKnvzuCZi6N64U03jrfW7YfwDh4Q5K) to provide [an independent, public assessment](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.fb.com%2Fnews%2F2019%2F05%2Fdtag-report%2F&h=AT3gKJ0FLl5op44FsppZWW85xwKaToxb4r9Uyev5Bvfnru4U9Q7t_MCLm-GykCrq0fipuVL_VdGwDeeOo0SpZFeHifUAZKssvjm5g2xJz1UJEg0BOWGfNzdAkNIV7SriqW3M0UFpwkw5BywWdp-QsF-CtstZbPyE) of whether the metrics we share in the enforcement report provide accurate and useful measures of Facebook’s content moderation challenges and our work to address them.\n  * We’ve been working with auditors internally to assess how the metrics we report can be audited most effectively. We’ve selected EY to undertake this engagement. We hope to conduct this audit starting in 2021.\n  * The [Oversight Board](https://oversightboard.com/) was created to help Facebook answer some of the most difficult questions around freedom of expression online: what to take down, what to leave up and why.\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/186536018_2810417659269476_7301858470198587690_n.jpg?stp=dst-\nwebp&_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=7785fb&_nc_ohc=bdj-\nDLJGK7QQ7kNvgEqZ10N&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr8-1.xx&_nc_gid=ARGVcuAkHZnXcK6G0DbecKG&oh=00_AYDYxA_jeIvgO0Jrpai4EGr_yl3rP40k1phuVoqg8hhZSQ&oe=675125D1)\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr8-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/186877943_1148419262238801_7897616599248298420_n.jpg?stp=dst-\nwebp&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=7785fb&_nc_ohc=ctZxMDhHBL4Q7kNvgH0uSli&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr8-2.xx&_nc_gid=ARGVcuAkHZnXcK6G0DbecKG&oh=00_AYCbVUjMYbUYFOR-\npwKvbKaHQt1igaui_5f4KluSh_AILg&oe=67513AD5)\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr6-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/185469422_1393904674302924_3011721396812163477_n.jpg?stp=dst-\nwebp&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=7785fb&_nc_ohc=kNNGm3eaWkQQ7kNvgFgNe7E&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr6-1.xx&_nc_gid=ARGVcuAkHZnXcK6G0DbecKG&oh=00_AYD5QxhZSAkrauGxaAfHa1zeIPI0igIxDllTwKH_XcYMOA&oe=675106F4)\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr8-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/185563191_926430728208514_4891603760383371848_n.jpg?stp=dst-\nwebp&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=7785fb&_nc_ohc=_6fZA430m-cQ7kNvgFSqkRu&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr8-2.xx&_nc_gid=ARGVcuAkHZnXcK6G0DbecKG&oh=00_AYAgdzSjFJTVUMRzvdNHdWZ1etBnuns46snScC7RieY4Fg&oe=67511D47)\n\n###

I decided to test that\nout.\n\n**How They Claim You Can Do It**\n\nThe process is simple: You start a Facebook page in a niche that is easy to\nmake AI generated content. The three most popular ones I have seen going\naround are food, travel and anything motivation related. You go to chatGPT and\ntype in “give me a name for a Facebook page about x” where x is your niche.\n\n**The Process**\n\n  1. I decided to go with dessert. You then also ask chatGPT (or your AI of choice) for prompts to generate the content. Since I went with dessert, I asked it to generate dessert recipes. \n\n  2. You then copy these prompts into an image generator. The one I see recommended a lot and the one I used is Ideogram. They have a free plan that you can use for up to 20 photos a day. \n\n  3. The images it generated were actually not that bad. You take these images and then paste it on your Facebook page. \n\n**Results:**\n\nYou can make $500 a day!! Right? ..right? Absolute BS.\n\nIn my 7 days of posting I got 2 accounts reached 1 of which was my own. 0\nlikes and 0 comments even after following the EXACT template these creators\npush.\n\n**Interesting Findings:**\n\n  1. Literally everybody and their mom promoting this BS has a discord or course they are selling. Think about it: If it was so easy making 500 a day from Facebook why would they be willing to give the formula for THIRTY DOLLARS a month..you are a product. Be careful. \n\n  2. Even if miraculously you do get 10,000 followers you will not make money through the FB bonus program since it’s INVITE ONLY. You need to get invited and the process for that is very unclear, a fact conveniently left out by these creators. \n\n**How To Actually Make Money From Facebook**\n\nClaim you can make $500 a day on FB and make Youtube videos about it.\n\nLol in all seriousness don’t waste your time making low effort content it\ndoesn’t work unless you get very lucky. Or actually if you think I should try\nout something else let me know and I will.\n\nRead more\n\n**Top 1%** [ Rank by size\n](https://www.reddit.com/best/communities/5/#t5_2v763/)\n\nPublic\n\nAnyone can view, post, and comment to this community\n\n* &nbsp;\n\n* * *\n\n* TOPICS\n\n* Internet Culture (Viral)\n\n  * [ Amazing ](https://reddit.com/t/amazing/)\n  * [ Animals & Pets ](https://reddit.com/t/animals_and_pets/)\n  * [ Cringe & Facepalm ](https://reddit.com/t/cringe_and_facepalm/)\n  * [ Funny ](https://reddit.com/t/funny/)\n  * [ Interesting ](https://reddit.com/t/interesting/)\n  * [ Memes ](https://reddit.com/t/memes/)\n  * [ Oddly Satisfying ](https://reddit.com/t/oddly_satisfying/)\n  * [ Reddit Meta ](https://reddit.com/t/reddit_meta/)\n  * [ Wholesome & Heartwarming ](https://reddit.com/t/wholesome_and_heartwarming/)\n\n* Games\n\n  * [ Action Games ](https://reddit.com/t/action_games/)\n  * [ Adventure Games ](https://reddit.com/t/adventure_games/)\n  * [ Esports ](https://reddit.com/t/esports/)\n  * [ Gaming Consoles & Gear ](https://reddit.com/t/gaming_consoles_and_gear/)\n  * [ Gaming News & Discussion ](https://reddit.com/t/gaming_news_and_discussion/)\n  * [ Mobile Games ](https://reddit.com/t/mobile_games/)\n  * [ Other Games ](https://reddit.com/t/other_games/)\n  * [ Role-Playing Games ](https://reddit.com/t/role_playing_games/)\n  * [ Simulation Games ](https://reddit.com/t/simulation_games/)\n  * [ Sports & Racing Games ](https://reddit.com/t/sports_and_racing_games/)\n  * [ Strategy Games ](https://reddit.com/t/strategy_games/)\n  * [ Tabletop Games ](https://reddit.com/t/tabletop_games/)\n\n* Q&As\n\n  * [ Q&As ](https://reddit.com/t/q_and_as/)\n  * [ Stories & Confessions ](https://reddit.com/t/stories_and_confessions/)\n\n* Technology\n\n  * [ 3D Printing ](https://reddit.com/t/3d_printing/)\n  * [ Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning ](https://reddit.com/t/artificial_intelligence_and_machine_learning/)\n  * [ Computers & Hardware ](https://reddit.com/t/computers_and_hardware/)\n  * [ Consumer Electronics ](https://reddit.com/t/consumer_electronics/)\n  * [ DIY Electronics ](https://reddit.com/t/diy_electronics/)\n  * [ Programming ](https://reddit.com/t/programming/)\n  * [ Software & Apps ](https://reddit.com/t/software_and_apps/)\n  * [ Streaming Services ](https://reddit.com/t/streaming_services/)\n  * [ Tech News & Discussion ](https://reddit.com/t/tech_news_and_discussion/)\n  * [ Virtual & Augmented Reality ](https://reddit.com/t/virtual_and_augmented_reality/)\n\n* Pop Culture\n\n  * [ Celebrities ](https://reddit.com/t/celebrities/)\n  * [ Creators & Influencers ](https://reddit.com/t/creators_and_influencers/)\n  * [ Generations & Nostalgia ](https://reddit.com/t/generations_and_nostalgia/)\n  * [ Podcasts ](https://reddit.com/t/podcasts/)\n  * [ Streamers ](https://reddit.com/t/streamers/)\n  * [ Tarot & Astrology ](https://reddit.com/t/tarot_and_astrology/)\n\n* Movies & TV\n\n  * [ Action Movies & Series ](https://reddit.com/t/action_movies_and_series/)\n  * [ Animated Movies & Series ](https://reddit.com/t/animated_movies_and_series/)\n  * [ Comedy Movies & Series ](https://reddit.com/t/comedy_movies_and_series/)\n  * [ Crime, Mystery, & Thriller Movies & Series ](https://reddit.com/t/crime_mystery_and_thriller_movies_and_series/)\n  * [ Documentary Movies & Series ](https://reddit.com/t/documentary_movies_and_series/)\n  * [ Drama Movies & Series ](https://reddit.com/t/drama_movies_and_series/)\n  * [ Fantasy Movies & Series ](https://reddit.com/t/fantasy_movies_and_series/)\n  * [ Horror Movies & Series ](https://reddit.com/t/horror_movies_and_series/)\n  * [ Movie News & Discussion ](https://reddit.com/t/movie_news_and_discussion/)\n  * [ Reality TV ](https://reddit.com/t/reality_tv/)\n  * [ Romance Movies & Series ](https://reddit.com/t/romance_movies_and_series/)\n  * [ Sci-Fi Movies & Series ](https://reddit.com/t/scifi_movies_and_series/)\n  * [ Superhero Movies & Series ](https://reddit.com/t/superhero_movies_and_series/)\n  * [ TV News & Discussion ](https://reddit.com/t/tv_news_and_discussion/)\n\n* * *\n\n* RESOURCES\n\n* [ About Reddit ](https://www.redditinc.com)\n* [ Advertise ](https://accounts.reddit.com/adsregister?utm_source=web3x_consumer&utm_name=left_nav_cta)\n* [ Help ](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=footer&utm_campaign=evergreen)\n* [ Blog ](https://redditblog.com/)\n* [ Careers ](https://www.redditinc.com/careers)\n* [ Press ](https://www.redditinc.com/press)\n\n* * *\n\n* [ Communities ](https://www.reddit.com/best/communities/1/)\n* [ Best of Reddit ](https://www.reddit.com/posts/2024/global/)\n* [ Topics ](https://www.reddit.com/topics/a-1/)\n\n* * *\n\n* [ Content Policy ](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy)\n* [ Privacy Policy ](https://www.reddit.com/policies/privacy-policy)\n* [ User Agreement ](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement)\n\n[Reddit, Inc. © 2024.

We recently completed an analysis of these Brand Lift\nStudies in order to identify best practices and characteristics of top-\nperforming content.\n\n**As you continue to communicate important information about COVID-19\nvaccinations and boosters, consider these six creative best practices to help\nyou have greater impact on your audience*:**\n\n**Feature trusted messengers:** Campaigns that feature trusted messengers are\nmore likely to resonate with audiences. Trusted messengers could vary by the\ntarget audience and may include health professionals, celebrities, community\nleaders or others. For example, [CARE\nUS](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.care.org%2Fnews-and-\nstories%2Fideas%2Fsocial-and-behavioral-change-communications-campaigns-to-\nreduce-vaccine-\nhesitancy%2F&h=AT3g2VahwAdPQc02NYzSXsvy5mS0-s9hBGkpyGfHYh1fTpa3Uzkb33VDF6tRW2hSlUoX5_F71FiVUl37hIZFRWcH00HQ5WnYVCkDHq0u6TCQ9VpK11Q2Nu9VQcUhfy7odl44AuYHNuV6gCft2k4CkEsPO6hcWK3b)\ndeveloped and tested assets that featured health workers, faith leaders and\ncelebrities to determine which messengers were most likely to influence their\ntarget audience.\n\n![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y4/r/-PAXP-deijE.gif)\n\nSomething went wrong\n\nWe're having trouble with playing this video.\n\n[Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/396404120401278/list)\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr6-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/73244193_459519834664888_7092065649463132160_n.png?stp=dst-\nwebp&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=7785fb&_nc_ohc=8CxwnRX5xUsQ7kNvgHnlUo0&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr6-2.xx&_nc_gid=APapXkpI4X4P_1hCsUaPPLl&oh=00_AYBKKjzaBAcGA1HAdj6UAII0XZALK4DeY4TAOOuvRP-6fw&oe=6751114A)\n\n**Engage audiences immediately:** Successful campaigns often start with a\nquestion or statement that immediately engages their audience, e.g. \"How do we\nknow the COVID vaccines are safe?\" Or, \"If I have had COVID, do I need to be\nvaccinated?\" Consider putting a question or key message at the beginning of a\nvideo to draw audiences in and use text overlay for static images. For\nexample, KFF's (Kaiser Family Foundation) [THE CONVERSATION / LA\nCONVERSACIÓN](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.greaterthancovid.org%2Ftheconversation%2F&h=AT0st98EIPobnPqA_Jzk-\nAnYzh8UxX1IOC9za0Gd4SxoJCqneITgnHCDB9VLAv8n6F7XjqjG9Btubm4inCRH_8L0jMkjLi4MjIltde80MtRpRCMj15qf1Lv-_0aK-7IUTOkaDg6O4jyaQyS6lJOEQto1PD4OFGKc)\nfeatures healthcare workers answering common questions about COVID-19\nvaccines.\n\n![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y4/r/-PAXP-deijE.gif)\n\nSomething went wrong\n\nWe're having trouble with playing this video.\n\n[Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/396404120401278/list)\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr6-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/73244193_459519834664888_7092065649463132160_n.png?stp=dst-\nwebp&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=7785fb&_nc_ohc=8CxwnRX5xUsQ7kNvgHnlUo0&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr6-2.xx&_nc_gid=APapXkpI4X4P_1hCsUaPPLl&oh=00_AYBKKjzaBAcGA1HAdj6UAII0XZALK4DeY4TAOOuvRP-6fw&oe=6751114A)\n\n**Hone in on a key topic and reflect this in your creative assets:** Our meta-\nanalysis showed that high-performing campaigns focused on one topic or, at\nmost, a few related ones (e.g. COVID-19 myth-busting). Therefore, consider\nfocusing on a specific topic or issue, rather than diluting messaging across\nmany different topics, which may confuse your audience. If you want to\ncommunicate a range of messages, consider splitting them across different ad\ncampaigns.\n\n**Balance video and static:** Our meta-analysis showed that campaigns that\ncombine video and static content tend to perform better than video-only\ncampaigns.\n\n**Simplify and shorten content:** We found that short videos are generally\nmore effective than longer ones. Campaigns with information that was easy to\nprocess and understand also performed better than highly technical content.\nFor example, [Direct\nRelief](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.directrelief.org%2F2021%2F09%2Fcovid-19-vaccine-\nacceptance-social-vulnerability-and-effective-message-design-in-the-\nus%2F&h=AT2-Dz-2h2gHxDHohbT5gdsTMEn5Cs3ycqRRM3GT75oG5XpmqbcfEsAIGmKUDMJsECihzLyswOlq_gEPPg1AH0A_UYq7_5oBYDWQQd3Ur3smDJu6Q7E3u8yNi-\nQiRa3F0wDYwMkpWE6F5u2MNlCAmcuiriwSBhEU) developed three short creatives to\nbuild confidence in vaccines, all of which were under 15 seconds in length.\n\n![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y4/r/-PAXP-deijE.gif)\n\nSomething went wrong\n\nWe're having trouble with playing this video.\n\n[Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/396404120401278/list)\n\n![](https://scontent-\nlhr6-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/73244193_459519834664888_7092065649463132160_n.png?stp=dst-\nwebp&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=7785fb&_nc_ohc=8CxwnRX5xUsQ7kNvgHnlUo0&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-\nlhr6-2.xx&_nc_gid=APapXkpI4X4P_1hCsUaPPLl&oh=00_AYBKKjzaBAcGA1HAdj6UAII0XZALK4DeY4TAOOuvRP-6fw&oe=6751114A)\n\n**Mobile-optimised assets:** Our analysis showed that ads that were most\neffective for mobile viewing were those that were designed specifically for\nmobile, e.g. with sound off or cropped to fit a mobile screen. Ensure that all\nassets are [mobile-optimised](https://www.facebook.com/business/news/5-ways-\nto-optimize-your-ad-creative-for-mobile) to help capture attention and allow\neasy viewing on a mobile device.\n\nBearing these best practices in mind can help government and charity\norganisations develop more effective ads and connect more effectively with\ntheir audiences.
